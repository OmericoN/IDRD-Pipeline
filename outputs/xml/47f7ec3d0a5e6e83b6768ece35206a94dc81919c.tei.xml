<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Designed to learn long-range interactions on sequential data, transformers continue to show state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of tasks. In contrast to CNNs, they contain no inductive bias that prioritizes local interactions. This makes them expressive, but also computationally infeasible for long sequences, such as high-resolution images. We demonstrate how combining the effectiveness of the inductive bias of CNNs with the expressivity of transformers enables them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution images. We show how to (i) use CNNs to learn a contextrich vocabulary of image constituents, and in turn (ii) utilize transformers to efficiently model their composition within high-resolution images. Our approach is readily applied to conditional synthesis tasks, where both non-spatial information, such as object classes, and spatial information, such as segmentations, can control the generated image. In particular, we present the first results on semanticallyguided synthesis of megapixel images with transformers and obtain the state of the art among autoregressive models on class-conditional ImageNet. Code and pretrained models can be found at https://git.io/JnyvK.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Transformers are on the rise-they are now the de-facto standard architecture for language tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> and are increasingly adapted in other areas such as audio <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. In contrast to the predominant vision architecture, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the transformer architecture contains no built-in inductive prior on the locality of interactions and is therefore free to learn complex relationships among its inputs. However, this generality also implies that it has to learn all relationships, whereas CNNs have been designed to exploit prior knowledge about strong local correlations within images. Thus, the increased expressivity of transformers comes with quadratically increasing computational costs, because all pairwise interactions are taken into account. The resulting energy and time requirements of state-of-the-art transformer models thus pose fundamental problems for scaling them to high-resolution images with millions of pixels.</p><p>Observations that transformers tend to learn convolutional structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> thus beg the question: Do we have to re-learn everything we know about the local structure and regularity of images from scratch each time we train a vision model, or can we efficiently encode inductive image biases while still retaining the flexibility of transformers? We hypothesize that low-level image structure is well described by a local connectivity, i.e. a convolutional architecture, whereas this structural assumption ceases to be effective on higher semantic levels. Moreover, CNNs not only exhibit a strong locality bias, but also a bias towards spatial invariance through the use of shared weights across all positions. This makes them ineffective if a more holistic understanding of the input is required.</p><p>Our key insight to obtain an effective and expressive model is that, taken together, convolutional and transformer architectures can model the compositional nature of our visual world <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>: We use a convolutional approach to efficiently learn a codebook of context-rich visual parts and, subsequently, learn a model of their global compositions. The long-range interactions within these compositions require an expressive transformer architecture to model distributions over their consituent visual parts. Furthermore, we utilize an adversarial approach to ensure that the dictionary of local parts captures perceptually important local structure to alleviate the need for modeling low-level statistics with the transformer architecture. Allowing transformers to concentrate on their unique strength-modeling long-range relations-enables them to generate high-resolution images as in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, a feat which previously has been out of reach. Our formulationgives control over the generated images by means of conditioning information regarding desired object classes or spatial layouts. Finally, experiments demonstrate that our approach retains the advantages of transformers by outperforming previous codebook-based state-of-the-art approaches based on convolutional architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>The Transformer Family The defining characteristic of the transformer architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> is that it models interactions between its inputs solely through attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref> which enables them to faithfully handle interactions between inputs regardless of their relative position to one another. Originally applied to language tasks, inputs to the transformer were given by tokens, but other signals, such as those obtained from audio <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> or images <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, can be used. Each layer of the transformer then consists of an attention mechanism, which allows for interaction between inputs at different positions, followed by a position-wise fully connected network, which is applied to all positions independently. More specifically, the (self-)attention mechanism can be described by mapping an intermediate representation with three position-wise linear layers into three representations, query Q ∈ R N ×d k , key K ∈ R N ×d k and value V ∈ R N ×dv , to compute the output as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Attn(Q, K, V ) = softmax QK t √ d k V ∈ R N ×dv . (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>When performing autoregressive maximum-likelihood learning, non-causal entries of QK t , i.e. all entries below its diagonal, are set to -∞ and the final output of the transformer is given after a linear, point-wise transformation to predict logits of the next sequence element. Since the attention mechanism relies on the computation of inner products between all pairs of elements in the sequence, its computational complexity increases quadratically with the sequence length. While the ability to consider interactions between all elements is the reason transformers efficiently learn long-range interactions, it is also the reason transformers quickly become infeasible, especially on images, where the sequence length itself scales quadratically with the resolution. Different approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational requirements to make transformers feasible for longer sequences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> restrict the receptive fields of the attention modules, which reduces the expressivity and, especially for high-resolution images, introduces assumptions on the independence of pixels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> retain the full receptive field but can reduce costs for a sequence of length n only from n 2 to n √ n, which makes resolutions beyond 64 pixels still prohibitively expensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Convolutional Approaches</head><p>The two-dimensional structure of images suggests that local interactions are particularly important. CNNs exploit this structure by restricting interactions between input variables to a local neighborhood defined by the kernel size of the convolutional kernel. Applying a kernel thus results in costs that scale linearly with the overall sequence length (the number of pixels in the case of images) and quadratically in the kernel size, which, in modern CNN architectures, is often fixed to a small constant such as 3 × 3. This inductive bias towards local interactions thus leads to efficient computations, but the wide range of specialized layers which are introduced into CNNs to handle different synthesis tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref> suggest that this bias is often too restrictive.</p><p>Convolutional architectures have been used for autoregressive modeling of images <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> but, for lowresolution images, previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> demonstrated that transformers consistently outperform their convolutional counterparts. Our approach allows us to efficiently model high-resolution images with transformers while retaining their advantages over state-of-the-art convolutional approaches.</p><p>Two-Stage Approaches Closest to ours are two-stage approaches which first learn an encoding of data and afterwards learn, in a second stage, a probabilistic model of this encoding. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> demonstrated both theoretical and empirical evidence on the advantages of first learning a data representation with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, and then again learning its distribution with a VAE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref> demonstrate similar gains when using an unconditional normalizing flow for the second stage, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref> when using a conditional normalizing flow. To improve training efficiency of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> learns a GAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> on representations of an autoencoder and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> on low-resolution wavelet coefficients which are then Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Our approach uses a convolutional VQGAN to learn a codebook of context-rich visual parts, whose composition is subsequently modeled with an autoregressive transformer architecture. A discrete codebook provides the interface between these architectures and a patch-based discriminator enables strong compression while retaining high perceptual quality. This method introduces the efficiency of convolutional approaches to transformer based high resolution image synthesis.</p><p>decoded to images with a learned generator.</p><p>[72] presents the Vector Quantised Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE), an approach to learn discrete representations of images, and models their distribution autoregressively with a convolutional architecture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> extends this approach to use a hierarchy of learned representations. However, these methods still rely on convolutional density estimation, which makes it difficult to capture long-range interactions in high-resolution images. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> models images autoregressively with transformers in order to evaluate the suitability of generative pretraining to learn image representations for downstream tasks. Since input resolutions of 32 × 32 pixels are still quite computationally expensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, a VQVAE is used to encode images up to a resolution of 192 × 192. In an effort to keep the learned discrete representation as spatially invariant as possible with respect to the pixels, a shallow VQVAE with small receptive field is employed. In contrast, we demonstrate that a powerful first stage, which captures as much context as possible in the learned representation, is critical to enable efficient highresolution image synthesis with transformers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Approach</head><p>Our goal is to exploit the highly promising learning capabilities of transformer models <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> and introduce them to high-resolution image synthesis up to the megapixel range. Previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> which applied transformers to image generation demonstrated promising results for images up to a size of 64 × 64 pixels but, due to the quadratically increasing cost in sequence length, cannot simply be scaled to higher resolutions.</p><p>High-resolution image synthesis requires a model that understands the global composition of images, enabling it to generate locally realistic as well as globally consistent patterns. Therefore, instead of representing an image with pixels, we represent it as a composition of perceptually rich image constituents from a codebook. By learning an effective code, as described in Sec. 3.1, we can significantly reduce the description length of compositions, which allows us to efficiently model their global interrelations within images with a transformer architecture as described in Sec. 3.2. This approach, summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, is able to generate realistic and consistent high resolution images both in an unconditional and a conditional setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Learning an Effective Codebook of Image Constituents for Use in Transformers</head><p>To utilize the highly expressive transformer architecture for image synthesis, we need to express the constituents of an image in the form of a sequence. Instead of building on individual pixels, complexity necessitates an approach that uses a discrete codebook of learned representations, such that any image x ∈ R H×W ×3 can be represented by a spatial collection of codebook entries z q ∈ R h×w×nz , where n z is the dimensionality of codes. An equivalent representation is a sequence of h • w indices which specify the respective entries in the learned codebook. To effectively learn such a discrete spatial codebook, we propose to directly incorporate the inductive biases of CNNs and incorporate ideas from neural discrete representation learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. First, we learn a convolutional model consisting of an encoder E and a decoder G, such that taken together, they learn to represent images with codes from a learned, discrete codebook Z = {z k } K k=1 ⊂ R nz (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> for an overview). More precisely, we approximate a given image x by x = G(z q ). We obtain z q using the encoding ẑ = E(x) ∈ R h×w×nz and a subsequent element-wise quantization q(•) of each spatial code ẑij ∈ R nz onto its closest codebook entry z k :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">z q = q(ẑ) := arg min z k ∈Z ẑij -z k ∈ R h×w×nz . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>The reconstruction x ≈ x is then given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x = G(z q ) = G (q(E(x))) .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Backpropagation through the non-differentiable quantization operation in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>) is achieved by a straight-through gradient estimator, which simply copies the gradients from the decoder to the encoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, such that the model and codebook can be trained end-to-end via the loss function</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L VQ (E, G, Z) = x -x 2 + sg[E(x)] -z q 2 2 + sg[z q ] -E(x) 2 2 . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>Here, L rec = x -x 2 is a reconstruction loss, sg[•] denotes the stop-gradient operation, and sg[z q ] -E(x) 2 2 is the socalled "commitment loss" <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>.</p><p>Learning a Perceptually Rich Codebook Using transformers to represent images as a distribution over latent image constituents requires us to push the limits of compression and learn a rich codebook. To do so, we propose VQ-GAN, a variant of the original VQVAE, and use a discriminator and perceptual loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> to keep good perceptual quality at increased compression rate. Note that this is in contrast to previous works which applied pixelbased <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref> and transformer-based autoregressive models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> on top of only a shallow quantization model. More specifically, we replace the L 2 loss used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> for L rec by a perceptual loss and introduce an adversarial training procedure with a patch-based discriminator D <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> that aims to differentiate between real and reconstructed images:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L GAN ({E, G, Z}, D) = [log D(x) + log(1 -D(x))] (5)</formula><p>The complete objective for finding the optimal compression model Q * = {E * , G * , Z * } then reads <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where we compute the adaptive weight λ according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Q * = arg min E,G,Z max D E x∼p(x) L VQ (E, G, Z) +λL GAN ({E, G, Z}, D) ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">λ = ∇ G L [L rec ] ∇ G L [L GAN ] + δ (7)</formula><p>where L rec is the perceptual reconstruction loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∇ G L [•]</formula><p>denotes the gradient of its input w.r.t. the last layer L of the decoder, and δ = 10 -6 is used for numerical stability.</p><p>To aggregate context from everywhere, we apply a single attention layer on the lowest resolution. This training procedure significantly reduces the sequence length when unrolling the latent code and thereby enables the application of powerful transformer models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Learning the Composition of Images with Transformers</head><p>Latent Transformers With E and G available, we can now represent images in terms of the codebook-indices of their encodings. More precisely, the quantized encoding of an image x is given by z q = q(E(x)) ∈ R h×w×nz and is equivalent to a sequence s ∈ {0, . . . , |Z|-1} h×w of indices from the codebook, which is obtained by replacing each code by its index in the codebook Z:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">s ij = k such that (z q ) ij = z k .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>By mapping indices of a sequence s back to their corresponding codebook entries, z q = z sij is readily recovered and decoded to an image x = G(z q ). Thus, after choosing some ordering of the indices in s, image-generation can be formulated as autoregressive next-index prediction: Given indices s &lt;i , the transformer learns to predict the distribution of possible next indices, i.e. p(s i |s &lt;i ) to compute the likelihood of the full representation as p(s) = i p(s i |s &lt;i ). This allows us to directly maximize the log-likelihood of the data representations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">L Transformer = E x∼p(x) [-log p(s)] .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Conditioned Synthesis In many image synthesis tasks a user demands control over the generation process by providing additional information from which an example shall be synthesized. This information, which we will call c, could be a single label describing the overall image class or even another image itself. The task is then to learn the likelihood of the sequence given this information c:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">p(s|c) = i p(s i |s &lt;i , c). (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>If the conditioning information c has spatial extent, we first learn another VQGAN to obtain again an index-based representation r ∈ {0, . . . , |Z c |-1} hc×wc with the newly obtained codebook Z c Due to the autoregressive structure of the transformer, we can then simply prepend r to s and restrict the computation of the negative log-likelihood to entries p(s i |s &lt;i , r). This "decoder-only" strategy has also been successfully used for text-summarization tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Generating High-Resolution Images The attention mechanism of the transformer puts limits on the sequence length h • w of its inputs s. While we can adapt the number of downsampling blocks m of our VQGAN to reduce images of size H × W to h = H/2 m × w = W/2 m , we observe degradation of the reconstruction quality beyond a critical value of m, which depends on the considered dataset. To generate images in the megapixel regime, we therefore have to work patch-wise and crop images to restrict the length of s to a maximally feasible size during training. To sample images, we then use the transformer in a sliding-window manner as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>. Our VQGAN ensures that the available context is still sufficient to faithfully model images, as long as either the statistics of the dataset are approximately spatially invariant or spatial conditioning information is available. In practice, this is not a restrictive requirement, because when it is violated, i.e. unconditional image synthesis on aligned data, we can simply condition on image coordinates, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>This section evaluates the ability of our approach to retain the advantages of transformers over their convolutional counterparts (Sec. 4.1) while integrating the effectiveness of convolutional architectures to enable high-resolution image synthesis (Sec. 4.2). Furthermore, in Sec. 4.3, we investigate how codebook quality affects our approach. We close the analysis by providing a quantitative comparison to a wide range of existing approches for generative image synthesis in Sec. 4.4. Based on initial experiments, we usually set |Z|= 1024 and train all subsequent transformer models to predict sequences of length 16 • 16, as this is the maximum feasible length to train a GPT2-medium architecture (307 M parameters) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> on a GPU with 12GB VRAM. More details on architectures and hyperparameters can be found in the appendix (Tab. 7 and Tab. 8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Attention Is All You Need in the Latent Space</head><p>Transformers show state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of tasks, including autoregressive image modeling. However, evaluations of previous works were limited to transformers working directly on (low-resolution) pixels <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, or to deliberately shallow pixel encodings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This raises the question if our approach retains the advantages of transformers over convolutional approaches.</p><p>To answer this question, we use a variety of conditional and unconditional tasks and compare the performance between our transformer-based approach and a convolutional approach. For each task, we train a VQGAN with m = 4 downsampling blocks, and, if needed, another one for the conditioning information, and then train both a transformer and a PixelSNAIL <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> model on the same representations, as the latter has been used in previous state-of-the-art twostage approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. For a thorough comparison, we vary the model capacities between 85M and 310M parameters and adjust the number of layers in each model to match one another. We observe that PixelSNAIL trains roughly twice as fast as the transformer and thus, for a fair comparison, report the negative log-likelihood both for the same amount of training time (P-SNAIL time) and for the same amount of training steps (P-SNAIL steps).</p><p>Results Tab. 1 reports results for unconditional image modeling on ImageNet (IN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Restricted ImageNet (RIN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, consisting of a subset of animal classes from ImageNet, LSUN Churches and Towers (LSUN-CT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, and for conditional image modeling of RIN conditioned on depth maps obtained with the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> (D-RIN) and of landscape images collected from Flickr conditioned on semantic layouts (S-FLCKR) obtained with the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Note that for the semantic layouts, we train the first-stage using a cross-entropy reconstruction loss due to their discrete nature. The results shows that the transformer consistently outperforms PixelSNAIL across all tasks when trained for the same amount of time and the gap increases even further when trained for the same number of steps. These results demonstrate that gains of transformers carry over to our proposed two-stage setting.</p></div>

All of these examples make use of the same methodology. Instead of requiring task specific architectures or modules, the flexibility of the transformer allows us to learn appropriate interactions for each task, while the VQGAN -which can be reused across different tasks -leads to short sequence lengths.

We evaluate this approach on unconditional image generation on LSUN-CT and FacesHQ (see Sec. 4.3) and conditional synthesis on D-RIN, COCO-Stuff and S-FLCKR, where we show results in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, 6 and the supplementary (Fig. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Note that this approach can in principle be used to generate images of arbitrary ratio and size, given that the image statistics of the dataset of interest are approximately spatially invariant or spatial information is available. Impressive results can be achieved by applying this method to image generation from semantic layouts on S-FLCKR, where a strong VQGAN can be learned with m = 5, so that its codebook together with the conditioning information provides the transformer with enough context for image generation in the megapixel regime.  FFHQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. It clearly demonstrates the benefits of powerful VQGANs by increasing the effective receptive field of the transformer. For small receptive fields, or equivalently small f , the model cannot capture coherent structures. For an intermediate value of f = 8, the overall structure of images can be approximated, but inconsistencies of facial features such as a half-bearded face and of viewpoints in different parts of the image arise. Only our full setting of f = 16 can synthesize high-fidelity samples. For analogous results in the conditional setting on S-FLCKR, we refer to the appendix (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> and Sec. C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Building Context-Rich Vocabularies</head><p>To assess the effectiveness of our approach quantitatively, we compare results between training a transformer directly on pixels, and training it on top of a VQGAN's latent code with f = 2, given a fixed computational budget.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Benchmarking Image Synthesis Results</head><p>In this section we investigate how our approach quantitatively compares to existing models for generative image synthesis. In particular, we assess the performance of our model in terms of FID and compare to a variety of established models (GANs, VAEs, Flows, AR, Hybrid). The results on semantic synthesis are shown in Tab. 2, where we compare to <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, and the results on unconditional face synthesis are shown in Tab. 3. While some task-specialized GAN models report better FID scores, our approach provides a unified model that works well across a wide range of tasks while retaining the ability to encode and reconstruct images. It thereby bridges the gap between purely adversarial and likelihood-based approaches.   Autoregressive models are typically sampled with a decoding strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> such as beam-search, top-k or nucleus sampling. For most of our results, including those in Tab. 2, we use top-k sampling with k = 100 unless stated otherwise. For the results on face synthesis in Tab. 3, we computed scores for k ∈ {100, 200, 300, 400, 500} and report the best results, obtained with k = 400 for CelebA-HQ and k = 300 for FFHQ.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper adressed the fundamental challenges that previously confined transformers to low-resolution images. We proposed an approach which represents images as a composition of perceptually rich image constituents and thereby overcomes the infeasible quadratic complexity when modeling images directly in pixel space. Modeling constituents with a CNN architecture and their compositions with a transformer architecture taps into the full potential of their complementary strengths and thereby allowed us to represent the first results on high-resolution image synthesis with a transformer-based architecture. In experiments, our approach demonstrates the efficiency of convolutional inductive biases and the expressivity of transformers by synthesizing images in the megapixel range and outperforming state-of-the-art convolutional approaches. Equipped with a general mechanism for conditional synthesis, it offers many opportunities for novel neural rendering approaches.</p><p>This work has been supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) projects 371923335, 421703927 and a hardware donation from NVIDIA corporation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. On Context-Rich Vocabularies</head><p>Sec. 4.3 investigated the effect of the downsampling factor f used for encoding images. As demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, large factors are crucial for our approach, since they enable the transformer to model long-range interactions efficiently. However, since larger f correspond to larger compression rates, the reconstruction quality of the VQGAN starts to decrease after a certain point, which is analyzed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>. The left part shows the reconstruction error (measured by LPIPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>) versus the negative log-likelihood obtained by the transformer for values of f ranging from 1 to 64. The latter provides a measure of the ability to model the distribution of the image representation, which increases with f . The reconstruction error on the other hand decreases with f and the qualitative results on the right part show that beyond a critical value of f , in this case f = 16, reconstruction errors become severe. At this point, even when the image representations are modeled faithfully, as suggested by a low negative log-likelihood, sampled images are of low-fidelity, because the reconstruction capabilities provide an upper bound on the quality that can be achieved. Hence, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref> shows that we must learn perceptually rich encodings, i.e. encodings with a large f and perceptually faithful reconstructions. This is the goal of our VQGAN and Fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref> compares its reconstruction capabilities against the VQVAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> Experiment  <ref type="table">8</ref>. Hyperparameters. For every experiment, we set the number of attention heads in the transformer to n h = 16. n layer denotes the number of transformer blocks, # params the number of transformer parameters, nz the dimensionality of codebook entries, |Z| the number of codebook entries, dropout the dropout rate for training the transformer, length(s) the total length of the sequence, ne the embedding dimensionality and m the number of downsampling steps in the VQGAN. D-RINv1 is the experiment which compares to Pixel-SNAIL in Sec. 4.1. Note that the experiment (FacesHQ, f = 1) * does not use a learned VQGAN but a fixed k-means clustering algorithm as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> with K = 512 centroids. A prefix "c" refers to a class-conditional model. The models marked with a ' * * ' are trained on the same VQGAN.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">n</formula><p>used in DALL-E <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. We observe that for f = 8 and 8192 codebook entries, both the VQVAE and VQGAN capture the global structure faithfully. However, the textures produced by the VQVAE are blurry, whereas those of the VQGAN are crisp and realistic looking (e.g. the stone texture and the fur and tail of the squirrel). When we increase the compression rate of the VQGAN further to f = 16, we see that some reconstructed parts are not perfectly aligned with the input anymore (e.g. the paw of the squirrel), but, especially with slightly larger codebooks, the reconstructions still look realistic. This demonstrates how the VQGAN provides high-fidelity reconstructions at large factors, and thereby enables efficient high-resolution image synthesis with transformers.</p><p>To illustrate how the choice of f depends on the dataset, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> presents results on S-FLCKR. In the left part, it shows, analogous to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, how the quality of samples increases with increasing f . However, in the right part, it shows that reconstructions remain faithful perceptually faithful even for f 32, which is in contrast to the corresponding results on faces in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>. These results might be explained by a higher perceptual sensitivity to facial features as compared to textures, and allow us to generate high-resolution landscapes even more efficiently with f = 32.</p></div>

Additional Results</head><p>Qualitative Comparisons The qualitative comparison corresponding to Tab. 4 and Tab. 6 can be found in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">14</ref>, 15, 16 and 17. Since no models are available for VQVAE-2 and MSP, we extracted results directly from the supplementary 3 and from the provided samples <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , respectively. For BigGAN, we produced the samples via the provided model <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . Similarly, the qualitative comparison with the best competitor model (SPADE) for semantic synthesis on standard benchmarks (see Tab. 2) can be found in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">40 (ADE20K</ref>) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">41</ref> (COCO-Stuff) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> .</p><p>Comparison to Image-GPT To further evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare to the state-of-the-art generative transformer model on images, ImageGPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. By using immense amounts of compute the authors demonstrated that transformer models can be applied to the pixel-representation of images and thereby achieved impressive results both in representation learning and image synthesis. However, as their approach is confined to pixel-space, it does not scale beyond a resolution of 192 × 192. As our approach leverages a strong compression method to obtain context-rich representations of images and then learns a transformer model, we can synthesize images of much higher resolution. We compare both approaches in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">27</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">28</ref>, where completions of images are depicted. Both plots show that our approach is able to synthesize consistent completions of dramatically increased fidelity. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> are obtained from https:// openai.com/blog/image-gpt/.</p><p>Additional High-Resolution Results Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">29</ref>, 30, 31 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">32</ref> contain additional HR results on the S-FLCKR dataset for both f = 16 (m = 4) and f = 32 (m = 5) (semantically guided). In particular, we provide an enlarged version of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> from the main text, which had to be scaled down due to space constraints. Additionally, we use our sliding window approach (see Sec. 3) to produce high-resolution samples for the depth-to-image setting on RIN in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">33</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">34</ref>, edge-to-image on IN in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">35</ref>, stochastic superresolution on IN in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">36</ref>, more examples on semantically guided landscape synthesis on S-FLCKR in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">37</ref> with f = 16 and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">38</ref> with f = 32, and unconditional image generation on LSUN-CT (see Sec. 4.1) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">39</ref>. Moreover, for images of size 256 × 256, we provide results for generation from semantic layout on (i) ADE20K in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">40</ref> and (ii) COCO-Stuff in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">41</ref>, depth-to-image on IN in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">42</ref>, pose-guided person generation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">43</ref> and class-conditional synthesis on RIN in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">44</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Nearest Neighbors of Samples</head><p>One advantage of likelihood-based generative models over, e.g., GANs is the ability to evaluate NLL on training data and validation data to detect overfitting. To test this, we trained large models for face synthesis, which can easily overfit them, and retained two checkpoints on each dataset: One for the best validation NLL (at the 10th and 13th epoch for FFHQ and CelebA-HQ, respectively), and another for the best training NLL (at epoch 1000). We then produced samples from both checkpoints and retrieved nearest neighbors from the training data based on the LPIPS similarity metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">45</ref>, where it can be observed that the checkpoints with best training NLL (best train NLL) reproduce the training examples, whereas samples from the checkpoints with best validation NLL (best val. NLL) depict new faces which are not found in the training data.</p><p>Based on these results, we can conclude that early-stopping based on validation NLL can prevent overfitting. Furthermore, the bottleneck for our approach on face synthesis is given by the dataset size since it has the capacity to almost perfectly fit the training data. Unfortunately, FID scores cannot detect such an overfitting. Indeed, the best train NLL checkpoints achieve FID scores of 3.86 on CelebA-HQ and 2.68 on FFHQ, compared to 10.2 and 9.6 for the best val. NLL checkpoints. While validation NLL provides a way to detect overfitting for likelihood-based models, it is not clear if early-stopping based on it is optimal if one is mainly interested in the quality of samples. To address this and the evaluation of GANs, new metrics will be required which can differentiate between models that produce new, high-quality samples and those that simply reproduce the training data.</p><p>Our class-conditional ImageNet model does not display overfitting according to validation NLL, and the nearest neighbors shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">46</ref> also provide evidence that the model produces new, high-quality samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. On the Ordering of Image Representations</head><p>For the "classical" domain of transformer models, NLP, the order of tokens is defined by the language at hand. For images and their discrete representations, in contrast, it is not clear which linear ordering to use. In particular, our sliding-window approach depends on a row-major ordering and we thus investigate the performance of the following five different permutations of the input sequence of codebook indices: (i) row major, or raster scan order, where the image representation is unrolled from top left to bottom right. (ii) spiral out, which incorporates the prior assumption that most images show a centered object. (iii) z-curve, also known as z-order or morton curve, which introduces the prior of preserved locality when mapping a 2D image representation onto a 1D sequence. (iv) subsample, where prefixes correspond to subsampled representations, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. (v) alternate, which is related to row major, but alternates the direction of unrolling every row. (vi) spiral in, a reversed version of spiral out which provides the most context for predicting the center of the image. A graphical visualization of these permutation variants is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">47</ref>. Given a VQGAN trained on ImageNet, we train a transformer for each permutation in a controlled setting, i.e. we fix initialization and computational budget.</p><p>Results Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">47</ref> depicts the evolution of negative log-likelihood for each variant as a function of training iterations, with final values given by (i) 4.767, (ii) 4.889, (iii) 4.810, (iv) 5.015, (v) 4.812, (vi) 4.901. Interestingly, row major performs best in terms of this metric, whereas the more hierarchical subsample prior does not induce any helpful bias. We also include qualitative samples in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">48</ref> and observe that the two worst performing models in terms of NLL (subsample and spiral in) tend to produce more textural samples, while the other variants synthesize samples with much more recognizable structures. Overall, we can conclude that the autoregressive codebook modeling is not permutation-invariant, but the common row major ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>                The transformer architecture is permutation invariant but next-token prediction is not: The average loss on the validation split of ImageNet, corresponding to the negative log-likelihood, differs significantly between different prediction orderings. Among our choices, the commonly used row-major order performs best.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Material</head><p>The supplementary material for our work Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis is structured as follows: First, Sec. A summarizes changes to a previous version of this paper. In Sec. B, we present hyperparameters and architectures which were used to train our models. Next, extending the discussion of Sec. 4.3, Sec. C presents additional evidence for the importance of perceptually rich codebooks and its interpretation as a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and sampling capability. Additional results on high-resolution image synthesis for a wide range of tasks are then presented in Sec. D, and Sec. E shows nearest neighbors of samples. Finally, Sec. F contains results regarding the ordering of image representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Changelog</head><p>We summarize changes between this version 1 of the paper and its previous version 2 .</p><p>In the previous version, Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) had a weighting term β on the commitment loss, and Tab. 8 reported a value of β = 0.25 for all models. However, due to a bug in the implementation, β was never used and all models have been trained with β = 1.0. Thus, we removed β in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>).</p><p>We updated class-conditional synthesis results on ImageNet in Sec. 4.4. The previous results, included here in Tab. 6 for completeness, were based on a slightly different implementation where the transformer did not predict the distribution of the first token but used a histogram for it. The new model has been trained for 2.4 million steps with a batch size of 16 accumulated over 8 batches, which took 45.8 days on a single A100 GPU. The previous model had been trained for 1.0 million steps. Furthermore, the FID values were based on 50k (18k) samples against 50k (18k) training examples (to compare with MSP). For better comparison with other works, the current version reports FIDs based on 50k samples against all training examples of ImageNet using torch-fidelity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. We updated all qualitative figures showing samples from this model and added visualizations of the effect of tuning top-k/p or rejection rate in Fig. <ref type="figure">14</ref><ref type="figure">15</ref><ref type="figure">16</ref><ref type="figure">17</ref><ref type="figure">18</ref><ref type="figure">19</ref><ref type="figure">20</ref><ref type="figure">21</ref><ref type="figure">22</ref><ref type="figure">23</ref><ref type="figure">24</ref><ref type="figure">25</ref><ref type="figure">26</ref>.</p><p>To provide a better overview, we also include results from works that became available after the previous version of our work. Specifically, we include results on reconstruction quality of the VQVAE from <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> in Tab. 5 and Fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref> (which replaces the previous qualitative comparison), and results on class-conditional ImageNet sampling from <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> in Tab. 4. Note that with the exception of BigGAN and BigGAN-deep <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, no models or sampling results are available for the methods we compare to in Tab. 4. Thus, we can only report the numbers from the respective papers but cannot re-evaluate them with the same code. We follow the common evaluation protocol for class-conditional ImageNet synthesis from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and evaluate 50k samples from the model against the whole training split of ImageNet. However, it is not clear how different implementations resize the training images. In our code, we use the largest center-crop and resize it bilinearly with anti-aliasing to 256 × 256 using Pillow [73]. FID and Inception Scores are then computed with torch-fidelity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p><p>We updated face-synthesis results in Tab. 3 based on a slightly different implementation as in the case of class-conditional ImageNet results and improve the previous results slightly. In addition, we evaluate the ability of our NLL-based training to detect overfitting. We train larger models (FFHQ (big) and CelebA-HQ (big) in Tab. 8) on the face datasets, and show nearest neighbors of samples obtained from checkpoints with the best NLL on the validation split and the training split in Sec. E. We also added Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>, which visualizes the effect of tuning k in top-k sampling on FID and IS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Implementation Details</head><p>The hyperparameters for all experiments presented in the main paper and supplementary material can be found in Tab. 8. Except for the c-IN (big), COCO-Stuff and ADE20K models, these hyperparameters are set such that each transformer model can be trained with a batch-size of at least 2 on a GPU with 12GB VRAM, but we generally train on 2-4 GPUs with an accumulated VRAM of 48 GB. If hardware permits, 16-bit precision training is enabled. </p></div>			</div>
