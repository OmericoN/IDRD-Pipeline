<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional feature encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works. We hope this effort will ignite further interest in the community to solve current challenges towards the application of transformer models in computer vision.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>T RANSFORMER models [1] have recently demonstrated exemplary performance on a broad range of language tasks e.g., text classification, machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and question answering. Among these models, the most popular ones include BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) v1-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The profound impact of Transformer models has become more clear with their scalability to very large capacity models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For example, the BERT-large <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> model with 340 million parameters was significantly outperformed by the GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> model with 175 billion parameters while the latest mixture-of-experts Switch transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> scales up to a whopping 1.6 trillion parameters!</p><p>The breakthroughs from Transformer networks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain has sparked great interest in the computer vision community to adapt these models for vision and multi-modal learning tasks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Manuscript received March, 2021.</p><p>However, visual data follows a typical structure (e.g., spatial and temporal coherence), thus demanding novel network designs and training schemes. As a result, Transformer models and their variants have been successfully used for image recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, image super-resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, video understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, image generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, text-image synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and visual question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, among several other use cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This survey aims to cover such recent and exciting efforts in the computer vision domain, providing a comprehensive reference to interested readers.</p><p>Transformer architectures are based on a self-attention mechanism that learns the relationships between elements of a sequence. As opposed to recurrent networks that process sequence elements recursively and can only attend to short-term context, Transformers can attend to complete sequences thereby learning long-range relationships. Although attention models have been extensively used in both feed-forward and recurrent networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Transformers are based solely on the attention mechanism and have a unique implementation (i.e., multi-head attention) optimized for parallelization. An important feature of these models is their scalability to high-complexity models and large-scale datasets e.g., in comparison to some of the other alternatives such as hard attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> which is stochastic in nature and requires Monte Carlo sampling for sampling attention locations. Since Transformers assume minimal prior knowledge about the structure of the problem as compared to their convolutional and recurrent counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, they are typically pre-trained using pretext tasks on largescale (unlabelled) datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Such a pre-training avoids costly manual annotations, thereby encoding highly expres- sive and generalizable representations that model rich relationships between the entities present in a given dataset. The learned representations are then fine-tuned on the downstream tasks in a supervised manner to obtain favorable results.</p><p>This paper provides a holistic overview of the transformer models developed for computer vision applications. We develop a taxonomy of the network design space and highlight the major strengths and shortcomings of the existing methods. Other literature reviews mainly focus on the NLP domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> or cover generic attention-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. By focusing on the newly emerging area of visual transformers, we comprehensively organize the recent approaches according to the intrinsic features of self-attention and the investigated task. We first provide an introduction to the salient concepts underlying Transformer networks and then elaborate on the specifics of recent vision transformers. Where ever possible, we draw parallels between the Transformers used in the NLP domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and the ones developed for vision problems to flash major novelties and interesting domain-specific insights. Recent approaches show that convolution operations can be fully replaced with attention-based transformer modules and have also been used jointly in a single design to encourage symbiosis between the two complementary set of operations. This survey finally details open research questions with an outlook towards the possible future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">FOUNDATIONS</head><p>There exist two key ideas that have contributed towards the development of conventional transformer models. (a) The first one is self-attention, which allows capturing 'longterm' dependencies between sequence elements as compared to conventional recurrent models that find it challenging to encode such relationships. (b) The second key idea is that of pre-training 1 on a large (un)labelled corpus in a (self)supervised manner, and subsequently fine-tuning to the target task with a small labeled dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Below, we provide a brief tutorial on these two ideas (Sec. 2.2 and 2.1), along with a summary of seminal Transformer 1. Several recent Vision Transformers demonstrate that the model can be learned end-to-end on ImageNet-1K without any dedicated pretraining phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. However, the performance generally remains lower than the pre-trained counter-parts. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>: An example self-attention block used in the vision domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Given the input sequence of image features, the triplet of (key, query, value) is calculated followed by attention calculation and applying it to reweight the values. A single head is shown here and an output projection (W) is finally applied to obtain output features with the same dimension as the input. Figure adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. networks (Sec. 2.3 and 2.4) where these ideas have been applied. This background will help us better understand the forthcoming Transformer based models used in the computer vision domain (Sec. 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Self-Attention in Transformers</head><p>Given a sequence of items, self-attention estimates the relevance of one item to other items (e.g., which words are likely to come together in a sentence). The self-attention mechanism is an integral component of Transformers, which explicitly models the interactions between all entities of a sequence for structured prediction tasks. Basically, a selfattention layer updates each component of a sequence by aggregating global information from the complete input sequence. Lets denote a sequence of n entities (x 1 , x 2 , • • • x n ) by X ∈ R n×d , where d is the embedding dimension to represent each entity. The goal of self-attention is to capture the interaction amongst all n entities by encoding each entity in terms of the global contextual information. This is done by defining three learnable weight matrices to transform Queries (W Q ∈ R d×dq ), Keys (W K ∈ R d×d k ) and Values (W V ∈ R d×dv ), where d q = d k . The input sequence X is first projected onto these weight matrices to get Q = XW Q , K = XW K and V = XW V . The output Z ∈ R n×dv of the self attention layer is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Z = softmax QK T d q V.</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Architecture of the Transformer Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The model was first developed for the language translation task where an input sequence in one language is required to be converted to the output sequence in another language. The Transformer encoder (middle row) operates on the input language sequence and converts it to an embedding before passing it on to the encoder blocks. The Transformer decoder (bottom row) operates on the previously generated outputs in the translated language and the encoded input sequence from the middle branch to output the next word in the output sequence. The sequence of previous outputs (used as input to the decoder) is obtained by shifting the output sentence to the right by one position and appending start-of-sentence token at the beginning. This shifting avoids the model to learn to simply copy the decoder input to the output. The ground-truth to train the model is simply the output language sequence (without any right shift) appended with an end-of-sentence token. The blocks consisting of multi-head attention (top row) and feed-forward layers are repeated N times in both the encoder and decoder.</p><p>For a given entity in the sequence, the self-attention basically computes the dot-product of the query with all keys, which is then normalized using softmax operator to get the attention scores. Each entity then becomes the weighted sum of all entities in the sequence, where weights are given by the attention scores (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, top row-left block).</p><p>Masked Self-Attention: The standard self-attention layer attends to all entities. For the Transformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> which is trained to predict the next entity of the sequence, the self-attention blocks used in the decoder are masked to prevent attending to the subsequent future entities. This is simply done by an element-wise multiplication operation with a mask M ∈ R n×n , where M is an upper-triangular matrix. The masked self-attention is defined by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">softmax QK T d q • M ,</formula><p>where • denotes Hadamard product. Basically, while predicting an entity in the sequence, the attention scores of the future entities are set to zero in masked self-attention.</p><p>Multi-Head Attention: In order to encapsulate multiple complex relationships amongst different elements in the sequence, the multi-head attention comprises multiple selfattention blocks (h = 8 in the original Transformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Each block has its own set of learnable weight matrices {W Qi , W Ki , W Vi }, where i = 0 • • • (h-1). For an input X, the output of the h self-attention blocks in multihead attention is then concatenated into a single matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[Z 0 , Z 1 , • • • Z h-1 ] ∈ R n×h•dv</formula><p>and projected onto a weight matrix W ∈ R h•dv×d (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, top row).</p><p>The main difference of self-attention with convolution operation is that the filters are dynamically calculated in-stead of static filters (that stay the same for any input) as in the case of convolution. Further, self-attention is invariant to permutations and changes in the number of input points. As a result, it can easily operate on irregular inputs as opposed to standard convolution that requires grid structure. Furthermore, it has been shown in the literature how selfattention (with positional encodings) is theoretically a more flexible operation which can model the behaviour of convolutional models towards encoding local features <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Cordonnier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> further studied the relationships between self-attention and convolution operations. Their empirical results confirm that multi-head self-attention (with sufficient parameters) is a more generic operation which can model the expressiveness of convolution as a special case. In fact, self-attention provides the capability to learn the global as well as local features, and provide expressivity to adaptively learn kernel weights as well as the receptive field (similar to deformable convolutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">(Self) Supervised Pre-training</head><p>Self-attention based Transformer models generally operate in a two-stage training mechanism. First, pre-training is performed on a large-scale dataset (and sometimes a combination of several available datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>) in either a supervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or a self-supervised manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Later, the pre-trained weights are adapted to the downstream tasks using small-mid scale datasets. Examples of downstream tasks include image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, zero-shot classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, questionanswering <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and action recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The effectiveness of pre-training for large-scale Transformers has been advocated in both the language and vision domains. For example, Vision Transformer model (ViT-L) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> experiences an absolute 13% drop in accuracy on ImageNet test set when trained only on ImageNet train set as compared to the case when pretrained on JFT dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> with 300 million images.</p><p>Since acquiring manual labels at a massive scale is cumbersome, self-supervised learning has been very effectively used in the pre-training stage. The self-supervision based pre-training stage training has played a crucial role in unleashing the scalability and generalization of Transformer networks, enabling training even above a trillion parameter networks (e.g., the latest Switch Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> from Google). An extensive survey on SSL can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. As nicely summarized by Y. LeCun <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, the basic idea of SSL is to fill in the blanks, i.e., try to predict the occluded data in images, future or past frames in temporal video sequences or predict a pretext task e.g., the amount of rotation applied to inputs, the permutation applied to image patches or the color of a gray-scale image. Another effective way to impose self-supervised constraints is via contrastive learning. In this case, nuisance transformations are used to create two types of modified versions of the same image i.e., without changing the underlying class semantics (e.g., image stylizing, cropping) and with semantic changes (e.g., replacing an object with another in the same scene, or changing the class with minor adversarial changes to the image). Subsequently, the model is trained to be invariant to the nuisance transformations and emphasize on modeling minor changes that can alter semantic labels.</p><p>Self-supervised learning provides a promising learning paradigm since it enables learning from a vast amount of readily available non-annotated data. In the SSL based pretraining stage, a model is trained to learn a meaningful representation of the underlying data by solving a pretext task. The pseudo-labels for the pretext task are automatically generated (without requiring any expensive manual annotations) based on data attributes and task definition. Therefore, the pretext task definition is a critical choice in SSL. We can broadly categorize existing SSL methods based upon their pretext tasks into (a) generative approaches which synthesize images or videos (given conditional inputs), (b) context-based methods which exploit the relationships between image patches or video frames, and (c) cross-modal methods which leverage from multiple data modalities. Examples of generative approaches include conditional generation tasks such as masked image modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and image colorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, image super-resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, image in-painting <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, and GANs based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. The context-based pretext methods solve problems such as a jigsaw puzzle on image patches <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, masked object classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, predict geometric transformation such as rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, or verify temporal sequence of video frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Cross-modal pretext methods verify the correspondence of two input modalities e.g., text &amp; image <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, audio &amp; video <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> or RGB &amp; flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Transformer Model</head><p>The architecture of the Transformer model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. It has an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder (middle row) consists of six identical blocks (i.e., N =6 in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), with each block having two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention network, and a simple positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. Residual connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> alongside layer normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> are employed after each block as in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Note that, different from regular convolutional networks where feature aggregation and feature transformation are simultaneously performed (e.g., with a convolution layer followed by a non-linearity), these two steps are decoupled in the Transformer model i.e., self-attention layer only performs aggregation while the feed-forward layer performs transformation. Similar to the encoder, the decoder (bottom row) in the Transformer model comprises six identical blocks. Each decoder block has three sub-layers, first two (multi-head self-attention, and feedforward) are similar to the encoder, while the third sublayer performs multi-head attention on the outputs of the corresponding encoder block, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>The original Transformer model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> was trained for the Machine Translation task. The input to the encoder is a sequence of words (sentence) in one language. Positional encodings are added to the input sequence to capture the relative position of each word in the sequence. Positional encodings have the same dimensions as the input d = 512, and can be learned or pre-defined e.g., by sine or cosine functions. Being an auto-regressive model, the decoder of the Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> uses previous predictions to output the next word in the sequence. The decoder, therefore, takes inputs from the encoder as well as the previous outputs to predict the next word of the sentence in the translated language. To facilitate residual connections the output dimensions of all layers are kept the same i.e., d = 512. The dimensions of query, key and value weight matrices in multi-head attention are set to d q = 64, d k = 64, d v = 64.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Bidirectional Representations</head><p>The training strategy of the original Transformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> could only attend to the context on the left of a given word in the sentence. This is limiting, since for most language tasks, contextual information from both left and right sides is important. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed to jointly encode the right and left context of a word in a sentence, thus improving the learned feature representations for textual data in an self-supervised manner. To this end, BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> introduced two pretext tasks to pre-train the Transformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> in a self-supervised manner: Masked Language Model and Next Sentence Prediction. For adapting the pre-trained model for downstream tasks, a task-specific additional output module is appended to the pre-trained model, and the full model is fine-tuned end-to-end. Here, we briefly touch upon the pretext tasks. (1) Masked Language Model (MLM) -A fixed percentage (15%) of words in a sentence are randomly masked and the model is trained to predict these masked words using cross-entropy loss. In predicting the masked words, the model learns to incorporate the bidirectional context. (2) Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) -Given a pair of sentences, the model predicts a binary label i.e., whether the pair is valid from the original document or not. The training data for this can easily be generated from any monolingual text corpus. A pair of sentences A and B is Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>: A taxonomy of self-attention design space. Existing approaches based on self-attention explore single-head or multi-head (transformer) designs for vision tasks. We note that interesting efforts have been made to utilize knowledge from convolution based architectures to improve ViTs (e.g., multi-scale and hybrid designs). We categorize the upcoming sections of this survey according to the types of self-attention block (left tree diagram) as well as the prominent tasks in computer vision (right). formed, such that B is the actual sentence (next to A) 50% of the time, and B is a random sentence for other 50% of the time. NSP enables the model to capture sentence-to-sentence relationships which are crucial in many language modeling tasks such as Question Answering and Natural Language Inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SELF-ATTENTION &amp; TRANSFORMERS IN VISION</head><p>We broadly categorize vision models with self-attention into two categories: the models which use single-head selfattention (Sec. 3.1), and the models which employ multihead self-attention based Transformer modules into their architectures (Sec. 3.2). Below, we first discuss the first category of single-head self-attention based frameworks, which generally apply global or local self-attention within CNN architectures, or utilize matrix factorization to enhance design efficiency and use vectorized attention models. We then discuss the Transformer-based vision architectures in Sec. 3.2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Self-Attention in CNNs</head><p>Inspired by non-local means operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> which was mainly designed for image denoising, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> proposed a differentiable non-local operation for deep neural networks to capture long-range dependencies both in space and time in a feed-forward fashion. Given a feature map, their proposed operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> computes the response at a position as a weighted sum of the features at all positions in the feature map. This way, the non-local operation is able to capture interactions between any two positions in the feature map regardless of the distance between them. Videos classification is an example of a task where longrange interactions between pixels exist both in space and time. Equipped with the capability to model long-range interactions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> demonstrated the superiority of non-local deep neural networks for more accurate video classification on Kinetics dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Non-local self-attention block <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> and Criss-cross self-attention module <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Figure is from <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>.</p><p>Although the self-attention allows us to model fullimage contextual information, it is both memory and compute intensive. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>(a), in order to encode global context for a given pixel location, non-local block <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> computes a dense attention map (in green). The non-local block <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> has a high complexity of O(N 2 ), where N denotes the number of input feature maps. To reduce this computational burden, Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> propose the crisscross attention module that for each pixel position generates a sparse attention map only on the criss-cross path, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5(b)</ref>. Further, by applying criss-cross attention recurrently, each pixel position can capture context from all other pixels. Compared to non-local block, the criss-cross uses 11× lesser GPU memory, and has a complexity of O(2 √ N ). State-of-the-art results are reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> for the semantic and instance segmentation tasks on several benchmark datasets including Cityscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, ADE20K <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, LIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> and CamVid <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>.</p><p>Another shortcoming of the convolutional operator comes from the fact that after training, it applies fixed weights regardless of any changes to the visual input. Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> proposed local relation networks to adaptively compose pixels in a local window. They introduced a new differentiable layer that adapts its weight aggregation based on the compositional relations (similarity) between pixels/features within a local window. Such adaptive weight aggregation introduces geometric priors into the network which are important for the recognition tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. Convolution is considered to be a top-down operator as it remains fixed across positions while a non-local operation such as introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> is a bottom-up method as it aggregates input features over the full image. The local relation layer belongs to the category of bottom-up methods but it is restricted to a fixed window size e.g., 7x7 neighborhood.</p><p>Bello et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> explore the possibility of employing self-attention as an alternative to convolutional operators. They employ the relative position encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> in two dimensions to develop a new self-attention mechanism that maintains translation equivariance, a desirable property for handling images. Although this self-attention provides competitive results as a stand-alone computational primitive, the best performance is obtained in combination with the convolutional operations. Authors show that attention augmentation leads to systematic performance gains in image classification and object detection for different architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Self-Attention as Stand-alone Primitive</head><p>As discussed above, convolutional layers possess translation equivariance but can not scale with a large receptive field, therefore can not capture long-range interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. On the other hand, global attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> which attend to all spatial locations of the input can be computationally intensive and is preferred on down-sampled small images, image patches <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or augmenting the convolutional features space <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Ramachandran et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> proposed to replace convolutional layers in deep neural networks with a local self-attention layer which can be applied to small or large inputs without increasing the computational cost. At a basic level, the proposed self-attention layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> considers all pixel positions in a specific window size around a given pixel, compute queries, keys and value vectors for these pixels, and then aggregates the spatial information within this window. The value vectors are aggregated after projecting the softmax score of queries and keys. This process is repeated for all given pixels and the response is concatenated to produce the output pixel. ResNet models with local self-attention layer can solve ImageNet and COCO object detection with fewer parameters as compared to ResNet models based on convolutional layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>.</p><p>Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> note that a traditional convolution operator performs feature aggregation and transformation jointly (by applying a filter and then passing it through a non-linearity). In contrast, they propose to perform feature aggregation separately with self-attention followed by transformation using an element-wise perceptron layer. For feature aggregation, they propose two alternate strategies: (a) pairwise self-attention and (b) patch-wise self-attention. The pairwise self-attention is permutation and cardinality invariant operation, while the patch-wise self-attention does not have such invariance properties (similar to convolution). Both pairwise and patch-wise self-attentions are implemented as a vector attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> that learns weights for both the spatial and channel dimensions. This provides an alternate approach for attention that is conventionally performed using scalar weights (by taking a dot-product). The pairwise self-attention is a set operator that computes a vector attention keeping in view the relationships of a particular feature with its neighbors in a given local neighborhood. In contrast, patch-wise self-attention is a generalization of the convolution operator (not a set operator) and looks at all the feature vectors in the local neighbourhood when deriving the attention vectors. Authors show that with considerably fewer parameters, self-attention networks (SAN) can beat ResNet baselines on the ImageNet dataset. They further show robustness against adversarial perturbations <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> and generalization to unseen transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. This behaviour is due to the dynamic nature of attention that makes it difficult for the adversary to calculate useful fooling directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Multi-head Self-Attention (Transformers)</head><p>Unlike the approaches discussed in Sec. 3.1 which insert self-attention as a component in CNN inspired architectures, Vision Transformer (ViTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> adapts the architecture of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), which cascades multiple Transformer layers. ViTs have gained significant research attention, and a number of recent approaches have been proposed which build upon ViTs. Below, we discuss these methods by categorizing them into: uniform scale ViTs having single-scale features through all layers (Sec. 3.2.1), multi-scale ViTs that learn hierarchical features which are more suitable for dense prediction tasks (Sec. 3.2.2), and hybrid designs having convolution operations within ViTs (Sec. 3.2.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Uniform-scale Vision Transformers</head><p>The original Vision Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> model belongs to this family, where the multi-head self-attention is applied to a consistent scale in the input image where the spatial scale is maintained through the network hierarchy. We name such models as the uniform-scale ViTs, as described below.</p><p>Vision Transformer (ViT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>) is the first work to showcase how Transformers can 'altogether' replace standard convolutions in deep neural networks on largescale image datasets. They applied the original Transformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (with minimal changes) on a sequence of image 'patches' flattend as vectors. The model was pre-trained on a large propriety dataset (JFT dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> with 300 million images) and then fine-tuned to downstream recognition benchmarks e.g., ImageNet classification. This is an important step since pre-training ViT on a medium-range dataset would not give competitive results, because the CNNs encode prior knowledge about the images (inductive biases e.g., translation equivariance) that reduces the need of data as compared to Transformers which must discover such information from very large-scale data. Notably, compared to the iGPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> model that also applied Transformers to full-sized images but performs training as a generative task, ViT pre-trains the model with a supervised classification task (although a self-supervision variant is also explored which results in a less performance).</p><p>The DeiT <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is the first work to demonstrate that Transformers can be learned on mid-sized datasets (i.e., 1.2 million ImageNet examples compared to 300 million images of JFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> used in ViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) in relatively shorter training episodes. Besides using augmentation and regularization procedures common in CNNs, the main contribution of DeiT <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is a novel native distillation approach for Transformers which uses a CNN as a teacher model (RegNetY-16GF <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>) to train the Transformer model. The outputs from the CNN aid the Transformer in efficiently figuring out useful representations for input images. A distillation token is appended with the input patch embeddings and the class token. The self-attention layers operate on these tokens to learn their inter-dependencies and outputs the learned class, patch, and distillation tokens. The network is trained with a cross-entropy loss defined on the output class token and a distillation loss to match the distillation token with the teacher output. Both soft and hard label choices were explored for distillation, where the hard distillation was found to perform better. Interestingly, the learned class and distillation tokens do not exhibit a high correlation indicating their complementary nature. The learned representations compare favorably well against top-performing CNN architectures such as EfficientNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> and also generalize well for a number of downstream recognition tasks.</p><p>Token to Token (T2T) ViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> recursively combines neighboring tokens into a single token to reduce tokens length and aggregate spatial context. Transformer in Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref> computes attention at two levels: patch-level (as done is standard ViTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) and local sub-patch-level (e.g.by subdividing a 16 × 16 patch into four 4 × 4 blocks, and computing attention amongst these blocks). In token labelling ViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>, all patch tokens contribute towards loss calculation, different from regular ViTs that only use classification token in the loss. This process includes auxiliary supervision where each image-patch (token) is labeled using a pre-trained CNN model. Similar to CutMix augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>, tokens from different images are mixed as an augmentation strategy, and the model is trained using the standard classification loss and auxiliary token-label loss. Their model demonstrates excellent performance specially for smaller sized models.</p><p>The quadratic complexity of self-attention hinders its applicability to longer sequences (high-resolution images). Cross-Covariance Image Transformers (XCiT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> incorporate attention across feature-channels instead of tokens, i.e., their cross-covariance attention is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Vsoftmax K T Q T √ τ</formula><p>. The proposed cross-covariance attention has linear complexity (since it depends upon feature dimension instead of the number of tokens). XCiT can therefore handle large resolution images and demonstrate excellent performance across different vision tasks i.e., self-supervised and fully supervised image classification and dense prediction (detection, segmentation). DeepViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> observes that the similarity between attention maps of deeper layer is high and hinders scaling models depth. They propose to re-attend the attention maps in a multihead block instead of simple aggregation of these attention maps, and show consistent gains over standard multi-head self attention based ViTs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Multi-scale Vision Transformers</head><p>In standard ViTs, the number of the tokens and token feature dimension are kept fixed throughout different blocks of the network. This is limiting, since the model is unable to capture fine spatial details at different scales. Initial Transformer based dense prediction methods (e.g., DETR <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) therefore have a convolutional backend. Multi-stage hierarchical design for ViTs, where number of tokens is gradually reduced while the token feature dimension is progressively increased, has been shown to produce effective features for dense prediction tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. These models generally also perform well for recognition tasks. These architectures mostly sparsify tokens by merging neighboring tokens and projecting them to a higher dimensional feature space. Examples of multi-stage ViTs include Pyramid ViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>, Twins <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, CoaT <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, Swin Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>, Shuffle Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, CrossFormer <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, RegionViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> and Focal Transformer models <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. Some of them are hybrid designs (with both convolution and self-attention operations, see Sec. 3.2.3), while others only employ pure self-attention based design (discussed next).</p><p>Pyramid ViT (PVT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> is the first hierarchical design for ViT, and proposes a progressive shrinking pyramid and spatial-reduction attention. PVTv2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> and SegFormer <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref> improve original PVT <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> by introducing overlapping patch embedding, depth-wise convolution, and efficient attention. Swin Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> has a multi-stage hierarchical architecture which computes attention within a local window, by partitioning the window into multiple subpatches. To capture interactions between different windows (image locations), window partitioning is gradually shifted, along the hierarchy of the network, to capture overlapping regions. Focal Transformer models <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref> is another hierarchical design, where focal self-attention is introduced to simultaneously capture global and local relationships. Similarly, CrossFormer <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref> has a hierarchical pyramid structure, and introduces cross-scale embedding module, along-with long short distance attention and dynamic position bias to faithfully capture both local and global visual cues. RegionViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> proposes a regional-to-local attention to encode hierarchical features. Multi-Scale Vision Longformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref> also considers a local context in self-attention, but employs the efficient Longformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref> design for selfattention. CrossViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref> encodes multi-scale features with two branches (each with multiple transformer blocks), by separately processesing smaller and larger image patches. The information from these two multi-scale bracnches is then fused together using a cross-attention module.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Hybrid ViTs with Convolutions</head><p>Convolutions do an excellent job at capturing low-level local features in images, and have been explored in multiple hybrid ViT designs, specially at the beginning to "patchify and tokenize" an input image. For example, Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref> incorporate convolution based projection to capture the spatial structure and low-level details, for tokenization of image patches. CvT has a hierarchical design, where number of tokens is progressively reduced while the token-width is increased, thus imitating the impact of spatial downsampling as in CNNs. Convolution enhanced image Transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref> employ convolutions based image-to-token module to extract low-level features. Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref> introduces a new sequence pooling scheme, and incorporates convolutional blocks (conv-pool-reshape) for tokenization. CCT can be trained from scratch on smaller datasets, e.g., CIFAR10 with ∼ 95% accuracy, which is a remarkable property not possible with the traditional ViTs.</p><p>LocalViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> introduces depthwise convolutions to enhance local features modeling capability of ViTs. LeViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> (name inspired from LeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>) applies a four-layered CNN block (with 3 × 3 convolutions) at the beginning with progressively increasing channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b255">256)</ref>. For a 3×224×224 input image, the resulting 256×14×14 output from the CNN block becomes input to a hierarchical ViT. By virtue of its design, LeViT is 5× faster than EfficientNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> on CPU, at inference. ResT <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> is another hierarchical architecture which applies a CNN block at the beginning for patch-embedding. It incorporates depth-wise convolutions and adaptive position encoding to tackle varying image sizes. A recent approach NesT <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> proposes a simple technique to introduce hierarchy in ViTs. NesT divides an image into non-overlapping blocks (each block is further split into patches). It first separately applies local selfattention on patches within each block, and then enables global interaction between blocks by aggregating them into an image space and applying convolution operation, followed by downsampling. The number of blocks is gradually reduced along the hierarchy of the model, while number of local-patches is kept fixed. This simple scheme performs favorably compared with more sophisticated designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>, and enables training NesT on smaller datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10) from scratch.</p><p>Depthwise Convolution and self-Attention Networks (CoAtNets) <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> introduce a relative attention module (which combines depthwise convolutions and selfattention), and vertically stack convolution and attention layers. CoAtNets demonstrate an impressive 86% Ima-geNet top-1 accuracy without extra data (i.e. trained only on ImageNet-1k). Shuffle Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref> performs selfattention within a window and has depth-wise convolutions between the window-based multi-head self-attention and MLP. It introduces a shuffle operation to build stronger cross-patch connections. Co-scale conv-attentional image Transformers (CoaT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, is a hybrid hierarchical pyramid design, with serial and parallel blocks, where the serial block is similar to standard transformer block except for the attention layer replaced with depthwise convolution. The parallel blocks is applied on the output of serial blocks and encodes relationships between tokens at multiple scales using cross-attention. Twins <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> builds upon PVT <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> (an attention only pyramid design), by replacing the absolute position embedding in PVT with relative conditional position embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>, and incorporating the separable depth-wise convolutions instead of the standard spatial attention, to capture local and global context of the image. In this sense, the hybrid designs tend to combine the strengths of both convolution and transformer models. TransCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref> propose a hierarchical multi-head self attention block, which first learns interactions within small grids (tokens) using self-attention, and then gradually merges the smaller grids into larger grids. The proposed block can then be plugged into existing CNN architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Self-Supervised Vision Transformers</head><p>Contrastive learning based self-supervised approaches, which have gained significant success for CNN based vision tasks, have also been investigated for ViTs. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref> evaluate different self-supervised frameworks and propose practical strategies including MoCo v3 (extended from v1/v2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>) for stabilized training of self-supervised ViTs. Xie et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref> combine MoCo v2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> and BYOL <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref> to train DeiT <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and SwinTransformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. They demonstrate generalization of self-supervised SwinTransformer for dense prediction tasks of detection and segmentation. Self distillation with no labels (DINO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref> demonstrate that self-supervised ViTs can automatically segment the background pixels of an image, even though they were never trained using pixel-level supervision, a phenomena otherwise not observed in CNNs or fully supervised ViTs. Efficient self-supervised vision transformer (EsViT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> propose a multi-stage design, where neighboring tokens are gradually merged along the hierarchy of the network, and use DINO for self-supervision. Apart from standard imagelevel self-supervision as in DINO, they incorporate additional patch-level self-supervision in which correspondence is promoted between similar patches within augmented versions of an image. EsViT demonstrates excellent performance under self-supervision settings, and its off-the-shelf features transfer better than supervised SwinTransformer on 17 out of 18 evaluated datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Transformers for Object Detection</head><p>Transformers based modules have been used for object detection in the following manner: (a) Transformer backbones for feature extraction, with a R-CNN based head for detection (see Sec. 3.2.2), (b) CNN backbone for visual features and a Transformer based decoder for object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref> (see Sec. 3.3.1, and (c) a purely transformer based design for end-to-end object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref> (see Sec. 3.3.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Detection Transformers with CNN Backbone</head><p>Detection Transformer (DETR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> treats object detection as a set prediction task i.e., given a set of image features, the objective is to predict the set of object bounding boxes. The Transformer model enables the prediction of a set of objects (in a single shot) and also allows modeling their relationships. DETR adapts a set loss function which allows Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>: Detection Transformer (DETR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> treats the object detection task as a set prediction problem and uses the Transformer network to encode relationships between set elements. A bipartite set loss is used to uniquely match the box predictions with the ground-truth boxes (shown on the right two columns). In case of no match, a 'no object' class prediction is selected. Its simple design with minimal problem-specific modifications can beat a carefully built and popular Faster R-CNN model. Figure from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>bipartite matching between predictions and ground-truth boxes. The main advantage of DETR is that it removes the dependence on hand-crafted modules and operations, such as the RPN (region proposal network) and NMS (nonmaximal suppression) commonly used in object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>. In this manner, the dependence on prior knowledge and careful engineering design is relaxed for complex structured tasks like object detection.</p><p>Given spatial feature maps from the CNN backbone, the encoder first flattens the spatial dimensions (see Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). This gives a sequence of features d × n, where d is the feature dimension and n = h × w with h, w being the height and width of the spatial feature maps. These features are then encoded and decoded using multi-head self-attention modules as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The main difference in the decoding stage is that all boxes are predicted in parallel while <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> uses an RNN to predict sequence elements one by one. Since the encoder and decoder are permutation invariant, learned positional encodings are used as the object queries by the decoder to generate different boxes. Note that the spatial structure in a CNN detector (e.g., Faster R-CNN) automatically encodes the positional information. DETR obtains performance comparable to the popular Faster R-CNN model <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref> which is an impressive feat given its simple design. The DETR has also been extended to interesting applications in other domains, e.g., Cell-DETR <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> extends it for instance segmentation of biological cells. A dedicated attention branch is added to obtain instance-wise segmentations in addition box predictions that are enhanced with a CNN decoder to generate accurate instance masks.</p><p>The DETR <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> model successfully combines convolutional networks with Transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to remove handcrafted design requirements and achieves an end-to-end trainable object detection pipeline. However, it struggles to detect small objects and suffers from slow convergence and a relatively high computational cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. DETR maps images to features space before using the Transformer for the relation modeling. Thus, the computational cost of selfattention grows quadratically with the spatial size of the feature map i.e., O(H 2 W 2 C), where H and W represent the height and width of the feature map. This inherently puts a limitation on the use of multi-scale hierarchical features <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref> in DETR training framework which is ultimately important to detect small objects. Furthermore, at the beginning of training, the attention module simply projects uniform attention to all the locations of the feature map and Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>: Axial attention module <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref> that sequentially applies multi-head axial attention operations along height and width axes. Image from <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>.</p><p>requires a large number of training epochs to tune attention weights to converge to meaningfully sparse locations. This approach contributes to a slow convergence rate of DETR. To mitigate the above-mentioned issues, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed a deformable attention module to process the feature maps. Inspired from deformable convolutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, deformable attention module <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> only attends to sparse set of elements from the whole feature map regardless of its spatial size. This further allows cross-scale aggregation of feature maps with the help of multi-scale attention modules without increasing the computational cost significantly. Deformable DETR not only performs better but its training time also remains 10× lower than the original DETR model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Anchor DETR <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref> replaces the learnable query tokens in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> with anchor-point based queries, such that each query focuses on predicting the object near the anchor point. The anchor points can be fixed on 2D grid, or learned from uniformly distributed points. Anchor DETR <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref> requires 10 × fewer training epochs with comparable performance. Pix2Seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref> is a generic Transformer-based framework, without any specialized task-specific modules, and learns to directly produce a sequence of tokens with object descriptions (bounding-boxes and class-labels). A quantization and serialization scheme first converts bounding boxes and class-labels into a sequence of discrete tokens. A generic Transformer based encoder-decoder network is then used to generate these tokens in an auto-regressive manner conditioned on previous predictions and image features.</p></div>

Global context can provide useful cues to deal with such a complex visual understanding task. Self-attention is effective at modeling long-range contextual information, albeit applying it to large inputs for a dense prediction task like panoptic segmentation is prohibitively expensive. A naive solution is to apply self-attention either to downsampled inputs or to limited regions around each pixel <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>.

White grid locations show masked inputs that have zero-contribution towards the self-attention. the perspective of generative modeling and learning unsupervised representations for down-stream tasks.</p><p>Parmar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref> develop an image generation model that can sequentially predict each pixel of an output image given its previously generated pixels (Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). Their approach models the joint distribution of the image pixels by factorizing it as a product of pixel-wise conditional distributions. Previously developed auto-regressive models for this task, such as the PixelCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>, suffer from a limited receptive field which hinders in modeling long term relationships in an image e.g., part relationships or occlusions. Using selfattention, <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref> enhances the receptive field without incurring a high computational cost (e.g., effective receptive field up to 256 pixels can be achieved as compared to 25 pixels of PixelCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>). The generative pipeline was also tested on conditional generation tasks e.g., image super-resolution, image completion, and denoising.</p><p>Inspired by the success of GPT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> in the language domain, image GPT (iGPT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref> demonstrated that such models can be directly used for image generation tasks, and to learn strong features for downstream vision tasks (e.g., image classification). Specifically, iGPT trains GPT v2 model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> on flattened image sequences (1D pixel arrays) and shows that it can generate plausible image outputs without any external supervision. The generated samples depict the model's ability to understand spatial relationships between pixels and high-level attributes such as object classes, texture, and scale. Notably, the design does not use any image-specific knowledge in the design (e.g., the 2D position embeddings used in Image Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>). The features learned with iGPT's unsupervised training mechanism compete impressively against other unsupervised approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10/100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref> and STL <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref> datasets while performing comparably to SimCLR (a contrastive learning approach) <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref> on ImageNet dataset. This is an astounding result, since the iGPT architecture is exactly the same as used for language modeling tasks, and therefore it does not incorporate any prior domain-specific knowledge. Notably, the competing unsupervised CNN based solutions widely adopt such priors in the form of architectural design, attention mechanisms, loss functions, and regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref>. However, on the downside, iGPT has a high compute cost e.g., iGPT-L version has roughly 36× high training cost compared to MoCo <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> which is a state of the art self-supervised feature learning approach. For this reason, the training was generally limited to lowresolution of ≤ 64 × 64, while convolutional architectures can effectively learn from high-resolution inputs.</p><p>Transformers typically incur a high compute cost when applied on high-dimensional sequences. To overcome this limitation, Esser et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref> proposed to include inductive biases (commonly used in the CNNs) alongside Transformers to improve their efficiency. Specifically, local connectivity and spatial invariance biases inbuilt in the CNN structure are leveraged by learning a rich dictionary of visual patterns (using a Generative Adversarial approach). A Transformer is then used to learn the long-range interactions between the dictionary items to generate the outputs. In turn, they develop a conditional image generation model capable of producing very high-resolution images (up to megapixel range) using Transformers. This is the first work that demonstrates the application of Transformers to generate such high-resolution images.</p><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> with CNNs as default backbone have been very successful for visually appealing image synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>. TransGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref> builds a strong GAN model, free of any convolution operation, with both generator and discriminator based upon the Transformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The architecture of both generator and discriminator is based upon the encoder in original Transformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For memory efficiency, the generator contains multiple stages, with up-sampling modules in-between, which gradually increase the resolution of feature maps (input sequence length) while reducing the embedding dimension. The discriminator of TransGAN takes flattened image-patches as tokens similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>. Authors introduce different training techniques including data augmentation, training with an auxiliary task and injecting locality to self-attention to scale-up their model for high quality image synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>. The TransGAN model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of Inception Score and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) on STL-10 and performs favorably compared with their CNN-based GAN counterparts on other datasets.</p><p>Unlike previous image generation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>, which directly predict image outputs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> learns to generate parameters of 3D objects to be placed in a given scene. Specifically, SceneFormer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> studies the 3D room layout conditioned scene generation task. Given the empty room shape, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> can propose new object configurations in the room while maintaining realism. Remarkably, the model does not use any appearance information and only learns to generate new scenes by modeling the inter-object relationships using self-attention in Transformers. Similar to how a Transformer operates on a sentence, it is applied to a sequence of objects to predict the next suitable object in a scene. Specifically, the size, pose, location, and category of the next object is predicted by the Transformer model. A start token indicates the initiation of inference and the number of output token indicate the objects generated by the model in a sequence. The authors also explore generating new scenes given a textual description of the room layout. The independence from the appearance makes the approach efficient, enabling interactive scene generation.</p><p>The task of generating realistic images from text is interesting and practically valuable (e.g., for artistic content creation), but at the same time highly challenging. Prior text-toimage synthesis approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref> are mostly based on GANs <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Although these methods produce encouraging results, they are far from being photo-realistic. Ramesh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> recently proposed DALL•E which is a Transformer model capable of generating high-fidelity images from a given text description. DALL•E model has 12 billion parameters and it is trained on a large set of text-image pairs taken from the internet. Before training, images are first resized to 256×256 resolution, and subsequently compressed to a 32×32 grid of latent codes using a pre-trained discrete variational autoencoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref>. DALL•E takes as input a single stream of 1280 tokens (256 for the text and 1024 for the image), and is trained to generate all other tokens autoregressively (one after another). It provides flexibility to generate images either from scratch (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10a</ref>) or by extending existing images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10b</ref>), while staying faithful to the text caption.</p><p>The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DALL•E by creating images from text describing a wide variety of real and fictional concepts.

Image restoration requires pixel-to-pixel correspondence from the input to the output images. One major goal of restoration algorithms is to preserve desired fine image details (such as edges and texture) in the restored images. CNNs achieve this by employing a single-scale architecture design that does not involve any downsampling operation. Since the computational complexity of self-attention in Transformer models increases quadratically with number of image patches, it is infeasible to develop Transformer model that can operate on single-scale feature processing pipeline. Consequently, these Transformer-based image restoration models make use of various strategies to reduce the computational burden, such as computing attention on local image windows <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref>, performing spatial reduction attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref>, and employing encoder-decoder design <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref>. Here, we briefly discuss a few image restoration Transformer models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.1">Transformers for Image Processing Tasks</head><p>Top performing algorithms for high-level computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation often employ backbone models that are pre-trained on largescale datasets e.g., ImageNet. In contrast, algorithms for lowlevel vision tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, and deraining are directly trained on task-specific data, thereby suffer from these limitations: (i) small number of images available in task-specific datasets (e.g., the commonly used DIV2K dataset for image super-resolution contains only 2000 images), (ii) the model trained for one image processing task does not adapt well to other related tasks. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> propose a pre-trained model based on Transformer architecture, named as Image Processing Transformer (IPT). It is capable of performing various image restoration tasks such as super-resolution, denoising, and deraining. The overall architecture of IPT consists of multiheads and multi-tails to deal with different tasks separately, and a shared encoder-decoder Transformer body. Since exploiting Transformers at full potential requires training on large-scale data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> takes the clean (ground-truth) images from the ImageNet benchmark and synthesize their degraded versions for different tasks. For example, bicubic interpolation is used for generating low-resolution images, additive white Gaussian noise is added to prepare noisy data, and hand-crafted rain streaks are applied to obtain rainy images. In total, 10 million images are used to pre-train the IPT model. During training, each task-specific head takes as input a degraded image and generates visual features. These feature maps are divided into small crops and subsequently flattened before feeding them to the Transformer encoder (whose architecture is the same as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). The outputs of the encoder along with the task-specific embeddings are given as input to the Transformer decoder. The features from the decoder output are reshaped and passed to the multi-tail that yields restored images. The IPT model is optimized with L 1 loss. Experimental results show that the pre-trained IPT model, when fine-tuned for a specific low-level vision task, can provide significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.2">Transformers for Super-Resolution</head><p>Recent years have seen major performance breakthroughs for super-resolution (SR) due to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Principally, the quality of super-resolved images generated by CNNs is dependent on the choice of optimization objective. While the SR methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref> that are based on pixel-wise loss functions (e.g., L1, MSE, etc.) yield impressive results in terms of image fidelity metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, they struggle to recover fine texture details and often produce images that are overly-smooth and perceptually less pleasant. Further, perceptual SR approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[174]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>, in addition to per-pixel loss, employ adversarial loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and perceptual loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178]</ref> based on deep features extracted from pre-trained CNNs. While these methods generate images that are sharp, visually pleasant, and perceptually plausible, they show a substantial decrease in reconstruction accuracy measured in PSNR/SSIM. Moreover, the perceptual SR algorithms have a tendency to hallucinate fake textures and cause artifacts. The above mentioned SR approaches follow two distinct (but conflicting) research directions: one maximizing the reconstruction accuracy and the other maximizing the perceptual quality, but never both.</p><p>To alleviate the trade-off between perceptual reproduction and accurate reproduction, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">11</ref>) consists of four core components: (1) Learnable texture extractor: takes as input LR↑, Ref↓↑, and Ref images, and generates texture features query (Q), key (K), and value (V), respectively. Here, ↑ denotes bicubic upsampling operation, and ↓↑ represents bicubic down-sampling followed by an upsampling operation. (2) Relevance embedding: first unfolds Q and K into patches and then computes the similarity of each patch in Q with each patch in K in order to generate hard and soft attention maps. (3) Hard-attention: transfers HR texture features from V to (LR features) Q using the hard attention map. (4) Soft-attention: further enhances relevant features while suppressing less relevant ones.</p><p>While TTSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> method deals with reference-based image super-resolution, most of the research is conducted on single image super-resolution problem in which only LR-HR paired images are available. Since the computational complexity of the original self-attention operation is prohibitively high for high-resolution images, recently a few efficient transformer models have been proposed that employ window-based attention (SwinIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref>) and spatial resolution reduction operation in attention module (ESRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref>) to perform super-resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.3">Colorization Transformer</head><p>Given a grayscale image, colorization seeks to produce the corresponding colorized sample. It is a one-to-many task as for a given grayscale input, there exist many possibilities in the colorized output space. The challenging nature of this task requires probabilistic models capable of producing multiple colorized output samples. Colorization Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is a probabilistic model based on conditional attention mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>. It divides the image colorization task into three sub-problems and proposes to solve each task sequentially by a different Transformer network. The authors first train a Transformer network to map a lowresolution grey-scale image to a 3-bit low-resolution colored image. Low-resolution images in turn allow training of larger models. The 3-bit low-resolution colored image is then upsampled to an 8-bit RGB sample by another Transformer network in the second stage of training. Finally, a third stage Transformer is trained to increase the spatial resolution of the 8-bit RGB sample produced by the secondstage Transformer. Self-attention used in the colorization Transformer is based on row/column attention layers introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>. These layers capture the interaction between each pixel of an input image while being computationally less costly. The row-wise attention layer applies self-attention to all pixels in a given row, while the column-wise attention layer considers pixels only in a given column of an image. This work <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is the first successful application of Transformers trained to colorize grey-scale images at high (256×256) resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Transformers for Multi-Modal Tasks</head><p>Transformer models have also been extensively used for vision-language tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[183]</ref>, visual commonsense reasoning (VSR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[184]</ref>, cross-modal retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[185]</ref> and image captioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Several works in this direction target effective vision-language pre-training (VLP) on large-scale multi-modal datasets to learn generic representations that effectively encode crossmodality relationships (e.g., grounding semantic attributes of a person in a given image). These representations can then be transferred to downstream tasks, often obtaining state of the art results. Notably, several of these models still use CNNs as vision backbone to extract visual features while Transformers are used mainly used to encode text followed by the fusion of language and visual features. Such models generally apply the vanilla multi-layer Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> with multi-modal inputs and do not introduce fundamental changes to the core attention block. However, their main distinction is in the configuration of Transformers and the loss functions, based on which we categorize them into: (a) Multi-stream Transformers (see Sec. 3.7.1) and (b) Single-stream Transformers (see Sec. 3.7.2). The single-stream designs feed the multi-modal inputs to a single Transformer while the multi-stream designs first use independent Transformers for each modality and later learn cross-modal representations using another Transformer (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>). Besides these vision language pretraining methods, we also explain visual grounding approaches towards the end of this section (see Sec. 3.7.3).</p></div>

The goal was to learn representations that can jointly model images and natural language. For this purpose, ViLBERT developed a two-stream architecture where each stream is dedicated to model the vision or language inputs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12-h</ref>). The architecture of both parallel streams is a series of Transformer blocks similar to the BERT model. Subsequently, coattentional Transformer layers are applied to learn crossmodal relationships. The co-attentional framework is very simple. Query, key, and value matrices are computed for each modality in the standard way <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and then key-value pairs for one modality are passed on to the other modality's attention head.</p><p>ViLBERT applies VLP on a set of proxy tasks defined on the Conceptual Concepts dataset (with 3.3M images with weak captions) and later fine-tune the model on downstream tasks such as VQA. The pre-training phase operates in a self-supervised manner, i.e., pretext tasks are created without manual labeling on the large-scale unlabelled dataset. These pretext tasks include predicting whether the text and image inputs are related and predicting the semantics of masked image regions and textual inputs (e.g., similar Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>: An overview of Transformer models used for multi-modal tasks in computer vision.

A key distinction between models is the choice of loss functions. While most of the multi-modal methods are focused on images as visual data, VideoBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and PEMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref> are designed to work on video streams and leverage unique modalities e.g., audio signals in videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref>.</p><p>to reconstructing masked words in text in the BERT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). This way, the model learns the inherent structure in the data during pre-training and also models cross-domain associations.

The main difference lies in the object-relationship encoder that is used to model the visual features instead of simple image-level features used in ViLBERT. The information in two streams is then fused across modalities using cross-attention blocks similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref>.</p><p>Compared to two pre-texts tasks used for VLP in <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref>, LXMERT uses five pre-training tasks including masked object and language prediction, cross-modality matching, and visual question answering (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12-g</ref>). The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the VQA task, however, a high similarity between pre-training and fine-tuned tasks raises questions on the generalizability of the learned representations to new tasks. To this end, the authors conducted generalization experiments on Visual Reasoning for Real (NLVR) task <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[186]</ref> demonstrating impressive improvements on novel tasks. Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref> note that the multi-modal representation learning approaches like VideoBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and ViLBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref> generally keep the language processing part fixed to a pretrained model (e.g., BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) to reduce training complexity. For the first time in the literature, they propose to learn an end-to-end multi-modal bidirectional Transformer model called PEMT on audio-visual data from unlabeled videos. First, short-term (e.g., 1-3 seconds) video dynamics are encoded using CNNs, followed by a modality-specific Transformer (audio/visual) to model long-term dependencies (e.g., 30 seconds). A multi-modal Transformer is then applied to the modality-specific Transformer outputs to exchange information across visual-linguistic domains. However, learning such a model in a naive form would incur huge memory requirements. To reduce parametric complexity, the parameters are shared across layers within each Transformer which leads upto 80% parameter reduction. The Transformer is trained using a contrastive learning approach based on a content-aware negative sampling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12i</ref>). Specifically, the model uses the features obtained from CNNs learned during the training phase to select negative samples that are visually similar to the positive instances. This work also compares various fusion strategies adopted in earlier works such as early (VideoBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and VL-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>), mid-level (ViL-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref> and LXMERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>) and late fusion mechanisms and shows that the mid-level fusion is the optimal choice. The proposed model is pretrained on Kinetics-700 <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[187]</ref> dataset and later fine-tuned on downstream video classification tasks such as short video classification on UCF101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[188]</ref>, audio classification on ESC50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[189]</ref> and long-term action recognition on Charades <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[190]</ref> and Kinetics-Sounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> datasets.</p><p>Tan and Bansal <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[191]</ref> introduce the concept of 'vokens' (images related to language tokens extracted from sentences). The vokens (visualized tokens) provide visual supervision to the language model to learn better features. The motivation is that humans learn languages by correlating visual information with semantic concepts. In a similar spirit to other self-supervised language representation learning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref>, they learn representations by defining an auxiliary task of voken-prediction task. Since the existing datasets encode limited visually grounded tokens, they propose a vokenization method to map language tokens to visual vokens, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>. The approach uses language-based retrieval for such a mapping and transfers a model trained on a small labeled dataset (MS-COCO) to a large dataset (Wikipedia). Furthermore, it was ensured that the sentence-wide context is considered to obtain the tokenvoken mapping. The resulting model trained using generated tokens outperforms the state of the art BERT model on a diverse set of NLP tasks. In this sense, the proposed model does not evaluate vision tasks, however, uses vision as a useful grounding cue to train the language model, hence we include it in the multi-modal representation learning group.</p><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to predict a navigation plan on a map based on the vision and language inputs. Transformer models were used earlier in <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[192]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref> for VLN task. These works first pre-train a crossmodal Transformer using self-supervision on vision and language pairs and subsequently fine-tune on the specific VLN tasks. While these works learn attention between image region and language, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[194]</ref> propose to learn cross-modal attention between language inputs and spatial topological maps (to represent an agent's environment as a graph whose nodes denote places and the edges denote their connectivity). Given the topological map and natural language inputs, a VLN task using the Transformer model bears resemblance to sequence prediction in NLP. Specifically, at each time instance, the cross-modal Transformer predicts a single node of the topological map in the navigation plan. The individual language and map encodings are first processed using uni-modal encoders and later a cross-modal encoder (similar to LXMERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>) is applied to aggregate information across modalities. To denote positions in the map, a learned trajectory position encoding is appended with the map features. Based on this Transformer setup, <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[194]</ref> reports a full navigation system that can freely explore the environment and intelligently plan its actions.</p><p>CLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[195]</ref> is a contrastive approach to learn image representations from text, with a learning objective which maximizes similarity of correct text-image pairs embeddings in a large batch size. Specifically, given a batch of N image-text pairs, CLIP learns a multi-modal embedding space, by jointly training an image-encoder and a text-encoder, such that the cosine similarity of the valid N image-text pairs is maximized, while the remaining N 2 -N pairs is minimized. The authors consider ResNet-50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> and Vision Transformer (ViT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref> for encoding images. The modified Transformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is employed for encoding text. CLIP is trained on a large corpus of 400 million image-text pairs and demonstrates excellent zero-shot transfer capabilities. At inference, the names of classes are used as input to the textencoder, and similarity of the encoded image is computed with all encoded texts (classes) to find the image-text pair with highest match. The CLIP achieves an astounding zeroshot classification accuracy of 75% on ImageNet, without using an supervision from ImageNet training set. The authors further demonstrate zero-shot transfer capabilities of the CLIP model on 30 different computer vision benchmarks. Note that CLIP with ResNet took 18 days to train on 592 V100 GPUs while CLIP with ViT took 12 days on 256 V100 GPUs. This highlights the computational cost of CLIP.</p></div>

The input sequence of text (e.g., caption) and the visual features corresponding to the object proposals are fed to the Transformer that automatically discovers relations between the two domains. Notably, VisualBERT architecture is somewhat similar to VideoBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> (explained in Sec. 3.8), but instead of only focusing on cooking videos, Visual-BERT evaluates on various visual-linguistic tasks (e.g., VCR, NLVR, VQA, and visual grounding). The VisualBERT model first applies task-agnostic pre-training using two objectives (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12-e</ref>). The first objective simply attempts to predict missing text tokens using the image features and remaining textual tokens. The second objective attempts to differentiate between the true and false caption of a given image. After task-agnostic pre-training, the authors propose to perform task-specific pre-training to bridge the domain gap before the final fine-tuning to the downstream task.</p><p>Su et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> propose a multi-modal pre-training approach to learn features that are generalizable to multimodal downstream tasks such as Visual Commonsense Reasoning and Visual Question Answering. This endeavor requires adequately aligning the visual and linguistic cues so that an effective composite representation is learned. To the end, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> builds on the BERT model and inputs both the visual and language features. The language features correspond to the token in the input sentence and the visual features correspond to the region of interest (RoI) from the input image (obtained via a standard Faster R-CNN). Specifically, the model is pre-trained on both the visuallingual dataset (Conceptual Captions <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[196]</ref>) as well as the language-only datasets (e.g., Wikipedia). The loss function is identical to BERT, where the model is trained to predict the masked out words or visual ROIs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12-f</ref>). In contrary to other works such as UNITER <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, VL-BERT claims that the visual-linguistic matching tasks are not useful during pretraining, which is in contrast to evidence from later efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>. Their results on several multi-modal tasks show their benefit over the language-only pre-training (e.g., in BERT).</p><p>Universal Encoder for Vision and Language (Unicoder-VL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref> learns multi-modal representations using largescale image-caption pairs. The language and image inputs are fed to a single Transformer model (with multiple successive encoders) to learn joint embeddings. To this end, it uses masked word prediction, masked object classification, and visual-linguistic matching as self-supervision tasks during pre-training (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12-d</ref>). Notably, the visual-linguistic matching is carried out only at the global level (i.e., imagesentence alignment). The model is evaluated on imagetext retrieval, zero-shot learning, and visual commonsense reasoning where it performs better than the previous models such as ViLBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref> and VisualBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. This shows the significance of rich self-supervised tasks and advocates for a unified Transformer architecture to learn multi-modal features in a common framework.</p><p>The Unified Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[197]</ref> model uses a single Transformer network for both encoding and decoding stages. This stands in contrast to BERT inspired VLP models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[198]</ref> which use independent encoder and decoder networks. Joint modeling of encoding and decoding stages allows the Unified VLP model to perform well for both image captioning and visualquestion answering tasks, when fine-tuned on these individual tasks. The intuition for shared modeling of encoding and decoding stage stems from the need to better share crosstask information during pre-training. The unified model consists of a stack of 12 Transformer blocks, each with a selfattention layer followed by a feed-forward module. The selfsupervised objectives used for pre-training include masked vision-language predictions. Here, the authors explore two variants i.e., bidirectional and sequence-to-sequence prediction of masked works where different context encodings are used for both types of objectives. The proposed approach is evaluated on COCO Captions, Flick 30K Captions and VQA 2.0 and obtains encouraging results compared to previous methods on image captioning and VQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[199]</ref>.</p><p>Universal image-text representation (UNITER) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> performs pre-training on four large-scale visual-linguistic datasets (MS-COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, Visual Genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[200]</ref>, Conceptual Captions <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[196]</ref> and SBU Captions <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[201]</ref>). The learned representations transfer well on downstream tasks such as VQA, Multi-modal retrieval, Visual Commonsense reasoning, and NLVR. In order to emphasize on learning the relationships between visual and language domains, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> specifically designs pre-training tasks to predict masked visual or text region conditioned on the other domain input, and align language and visual inputs on both the global (image-text) and local (word-region) levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12-a</ref>). These tasks are beside the conventional masked language modeling task used in BERT and explicitly include fine-grained wordregion alignment alongside conditional masking of inputs that were not considered in the earlier works such as VL-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Visual-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, Vilbert <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref> and Unicoder-VL <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>. Common to the other approaches, they adopt the Transformer architecture proposed in BERT that operates on both the visual and language embeddings. In contrast to applying independent Transformers to the language and visual inputs (as in ViLBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref> and LXMERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>), Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>: Visualized tokens (Vokens) <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[191]</ref>: A language model is visually supervised using closely related images that leads to better feature representations from the pretrained model. Figure from <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[191]</ref>.</p><p>UNITER adopts a single Transformer applied to the textual and image inputs like <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>.</p><p>VisualBert <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, Uniter <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, VL-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, VilBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref>, and Unicoder-VL <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref> models for VLP concatenate image and text features and leave it to the self-attention to automatically discover cross-modal relationships. This can complicate the visual grounding of semantic concepts in an image. To address this problem, Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-Training (Oscar) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> first uses an object detector to obtain object tags (labels), which are then subsequently used as a mechanism to align relevant visual features with the semantic information (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12-b</ref>). The motivation is that the textual content generally pertains to major objects in the image, therefore by explicitly adding those image labels to the input, visual features can be better attended. Similar to BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Oscar uses a Masked Token Loss for VLP, where different tokens in the textual input and image tags are randomly masked and the model predicts these missing tokens. Further, it also uses a contrastive loss that discriminates between the original and noisy/fake image-tag pairs. The representations thus learned are fine-tuned on VQA, crossmodality retrieval, natural language reasoning, and image captioning tasks to obtain better performances compared to VLP methods that do not use object tags. The recent VinVL <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[202]</ref> approach extends Oscar for the object detection task and learns object instance-centered relationships between visual and language domains using an adapted pretraining scheme. The model is trained on a collection of datasets (MS-COCO, OpenImages, Visual Genome and Objects365) and was demonstrated to precisely relate semantic attributes with the visual information and provided better transferability to the downstream visual comprehension tasks.</p></div>

The visual and text features are then separately linearly projected to a shared space, concatenated and fed to a transformer model (with an architecture similar to DETR) to predict the bounding boxes for objects corresponding to the queries in the grounding text. The model is trained by using a loss which predicts a uniform distribution over all relevant text query tokens specific to the predicted bounding boxes. An additional contrastive loss term ensures correspondence between visual and text embedding. TransVG <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[204]</ref> is a simple design, where visual and text features are fused together in a transformer module, and the boundingbox corresponding to the query is directly regressed using a learnable token (input to the Transformer module, along-with visual and text features). Referring Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[205]</ref> is also a simple one stage design where the text and image features are fused in a Transformer encoder, and the Transformer based decoder then directly regresses bounding boxes or segmentation masks. Visual Grounding with Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[206]</ref> has an encoder-decoder architecture, where visual tokens (features extracted from a pretrained CNN model) and text tokens (parsed through an RNN module) are processed in parallel with two distinct branches in the encoder, with cross-modality attention to generate text-guided visual features. The decoder then computes attention between the text queries and visual features and predicts query-specific bounding boxes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.1">Joint Video and Language Modeling</head><p>The VideoBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> model leverages Transformer networks and the strength of self-supervised learning to learn effective multi-modal representations. Specifically, VideoBERT uses the prediction of masked visual and linguistic tokens as a pretext task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12-c</ref>). This allows modeling high-level semantics and long-range temporal dependencies, important for video understanding tasks. Given a video, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> converts speech to text using off-the-shelf speech recognition systems and applies vector quantization (clustering) to obtain visual features from pre-trained video classification models. The BERT model is then directly applied to these concatenated sequences of language and visual tokens to learn their joint distribution. The model can be trained with only-text, video-only, and video+text domains. The resulting model showcases interesting capabilities for cross-modal predictions such as video generation from a given textual input (e.g., captions or cooking recipe) and (video-based) future forecasting. The video+text model uses a visual-linguistic alignment task to learn cross-modality relationships. The definition of this pre-text task is simple, given the latent state of the [cls] token, the task is to predict whether the sentence is temporally aligned with the sequence of visual tokens. Further, the learned representations are shown to be very useful for downstream tasks such as action classification, zero-shot classification, and video captioning.</p><p>Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref> explore Masked Transformers for dense video captioning. This requires generating language descriptions for all events occurring in a video. Existing works on this problem generally operate sequentially i.e., first detect events and then generate captions in separate subblocks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref> proposes a unified Transformer network to tackle both tasks jointly, thereby seamlessly integrating the multi-modal tasks of event detection and captioning. First, a video encoder is used to obtain frame-wise representations followed by two decoder blocks focused on proposing the video events and the captions. Since untrimmed videos are considered, a masking network is used in the captioning decoder to focus on describing a single event proposal. Remarkably, <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref> was the first approach to target dense video captioning using non-recurrent models and used selfattention in the encoder(applied on CNN derived features) to model broad range context between video frames. Experiments on ActivityNet Captions <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[214]</ref> and YouCookII <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">[215]</ref> datasets showed good improvements over previous recurrent network and two-stage based approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.2">Video Action Recognition</head><p>The traditional CNN based methods in video classification generally perform 3D spatio-temporal processing over limited intervals to understand videos. Neimark et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[211]</ref> propose Video Transformer Network (VTN) that first obtains frame-wise features using 2D CNN and apply a Transformer encoder (Longformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>) on top to learn temporal relationships. Longformer is an attractive choice to process long sequences (with an arbitrary length n) due to its O(n) complexity. The classification token is passed through a fully connected layer to recognize actions or events. The advantage of using Transformer encoder on top of spatial features is two fold: (a) it allows processing a complete video in a single pass, and (b) considerably improves training and inference efficiency by avoiding the expensive 3D convolutions. This makes VTN particularly suitable for modeling long videos where interactions between entities are spread throughout the video length. Their experiments on Kinetics-400 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> with various backbones (ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, ViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and DeiT <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) shows competitive performance.</p><p>Girdhar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> use a variant of Transformer architecture to aggregate person-specific contextual cues in a video for action classification and localization. Initially, the model uses a Faster-RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref> style processing where a backbone model generates features that are forwarded to the Region Proposal Network to obtain object proposals. Then RoI pooling is applied to generate object-specific features. Multi-head self-attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is then applied on top of the object features as a cascade of self-attention layers. In each Transformer unit, a particular person feature is treated as the 'query' (Q), while the features from the neighboring video clip are used as 'key' (K) and 'value' (V). The location information is explicitly encoded in the input feature map from which K, V and Q are derived, thus incorporating the positional information in the self-attention. For a given 400×400×64 video clip, the key and value tensors are of size 16×25×25×128, while the query is 128 dimensional vector. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> uses only RGB stream, additional modalities like optical flow and audio signal (as in competing works) would further increase the compute complexity. Further, the Transformer model was found to be sub-optimal for action localization, perhaps due to its tendency to incorporate global information. Therefore, it is important to achieve the right trade-off between the global and local context for problems that demand precise delineation (e.g., action localization and segmentation).</p><p>Human action recognition based on skeleton representation requires understanding relationships between different joints of a body in a given frame as well as between different frames of a video. Plizzari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[216]</ref> proposed a two-stream Transformer network to model such relationships. They introduced spatial self-attention (SSA) to model relations between different body-joints (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14a</ref>) while temporal selfattention (TSA) to capture long-range inter-frame dependencies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14b</ref>). They first used a small residual network to extract features from skeleton data and then used SSA and TSA modules to process those feature maps. SSA finds the correlation between each pair of joints independently, while TSA focuses on how features of a certain joint change between frames along the temporal dimension. The purpose of SSA is to discover relationships among the surrounding joints in the same way as the Transformer relates different words in a phrase. On the other hand, TSA finds long-range relations between frames, similar to how relations among phrases are built in NLP. The two streamed model achieves state-of-the-art results on NTU-RGB+D 60 <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[217]</ref> and NTU-RGB+D 120 <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">[218]</ref> datasets.</p><p>Multiscale Vision Transformers (MViT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">[219]</ref> build a feature hierarchy by progressively expanding the channel capacity and reducing the spatio-temporal resolution in videos. They introduce multi-head pooling attention to gradually change the visual resolution in their pyramid structure. TimeSFormer <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[213]</ref> extends ViTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref> to videos, by considering the video as a sequence of patches extracted from individual frames. To capture spatio-temporal relationships, they propose divided attention i.e., spatial and temporal attentions are separately applied within each block. TimeSFormer demonstrates SoTA performance on action recognition, and can be applied to clips over one minute. Another notable pure-transformer based model is the Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[212]</ref>. First, the spatiotemporal tokens are extracted and then efficient factorised versions of self-attention are applied to encode relationships between tokens. However, they require initialization with image-pretrained models to effectively learn the ViT models. There has also been concurrent work on learning sound pretrained models using self-supervised learning with ViTs. An important recent effort is the long-short contrastive learning (LSTCL) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[220]</ref>, which reconstructs representations from different time-scales (narrow and broad) as auxiliary learning tasks and demonstrates good downstream performance.</p></div>

Transformer models have been used to learn set-to-set mappings on this support set <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> or learn the spatial relationships between a given input query and support set samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In terms of absolute performance, the patch-wise spatial self-attention between query and support set images excels compared to an image level association learned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. However, the patch-wise attention computation is computationally expensive. We elaborate on these approaches below. Doersch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> explore the utility of self-supervision and Transformer model for few-shot fine-grained classification, where distribution mismatch exists between training Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">15</ref>: An overview of FEAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Compared to the conventional instance embedding methods in FSL that keep the embedding function same for all tasks (a), FEAT uses a setto-set function to adapt the embedding function to each FSL task (b). It evaluates several set-to-set functions and found the Transformer module to be the most suitable choice for FSL. Figure from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. and evaluation phases. They develop Cross-Transformer model to relate a given query image with the few-examples available in the support set. To this end, the Transformer finds spatially similar regions in the query and support set images, and the corresponding features are then used to obtain class decisions for the query. The queries in the Transformer architecture are derived from the grid features obtained using the query image. Similarly, grid features from the support images are used to construct keys and values which are in turn used to derive attended outputs. This approach, besides a contrastive self-supervision based training mechanism, leads to the best performance on the Meta-dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">[223]</ref>.</p><p>Ye et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> propose to adapt the few-shot embeddings learned on the base classes to the few-shot target classes during inference using a Transformer module. This leads to task-specific embeddings that perform better on the discriminative tasks such as few-shot classification. While many other set-to-set functions are also evaluated, such as Graph convolutional networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">[224]</ref>, Bidirectional LSTMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and DeepSets <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">[225]</ref>, the best performance is achieved with the Transformer-based mapping. This is attributed to the better contextualization, task interpolation and extrapolation capability of Transformers and their permutation invariance while maintaining a relatively lower parameter complexity. The Transformer architecture in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> follows the standard model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The embeddings are adapted using a contrastive loss function for preserving discriminative properties (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">15</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.10">Transformers for Clustering</head><p>Clustering aims to discover structure in the data by grouping similar data points together. It has numerous applications such as data visualization and interpretation, anomaly detection, and open-set categorization. Neural networks have been developed for set prediction problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">[225]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">[227]</ref>, however, the setpoints are processed individually which can lose information about inter-point relationships. Recent works employ Transformers that operate on set inputs called the Set Transformers (ST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[228]</ref> for amortized clustering. Amortized clustering is a challenging problem that seeks to learn a parametric function that can map an input set of points to their corresponding cluster centers. Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[228]</ref> propose to learn such a mapping function using a Transformer architecture comprising of multi-head selfattention blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The Transformer model is permutation invariant by design and allows encoding both pair-wise and higher-order relationships between the input points. However, a full Transformer would lead to a high computational cost of O(n 2 ) in each self-attention layer, where n is the number of points in the set. ST reduces this cost to O(mn) by using an Induced Self-Attention Block that uses a lowrank projection (H ∈ R m ) to allow operating on large sets. The model was trained to learn optimal parameters that maximize the likelihood of a mixture of Gaussians (MoGs). Thus MoG parameters are estimated by the ST given a set of data points. Beyond amortized clustering, ST is a generic framework which can handle other set-input problems such as counting unique elements in an input set, multi-instance learning, set anomaly detection, and 3D point-cloud classification. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">[229]</ref> improves <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[228]</ref> by taking a sequential approach to cluster generation, thereby allowing assignment to a variable number of clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11">Transformers for 3D Analysis</head><p>Given the irregular (variable number of points) and permutation invariant nature of 3D point cloud representations, Transformers provide a promising mechanism to encode rich relationships between 3D data points. To this end, recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[230]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[231]</ref> are motivated by the capability of Transformers to learn set-functions. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[230]</ref> introduced a Point Transformer which uses vector attention to learn weights for each channel, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[231]</ref> suggest an alternate design where local 3D structure is explicitly encoded. The non-local nature of Transformers is exploited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> towards an accurate human pose and mesh reconstruction algorithm. We discuss these approaches below.</p><p>Self-attention being a set-operator is ideally suited for processing point clouds, a 3D data representation that demands invariance to number of points and their permutations. Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[230]</ref> propose a point Transformer layer that applies self-attention in the local neighborhood of 3D points. The proposed layer builds on vectorized self-attention network (SAN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> where attention weights are represented with vectors.Furthermore, a positional encoding is added both to the attention vector and transformed features (value vectors) to represent location information. The point Transformer layer is sandwiched between two linear layers to create a point Transformer block that is stacked multiple times in the developed network architecture. Their design also included transition down/up blocks to reduce/increase the number of points in the input (in a typical encodingdecoding pipeline style). The resulting architecture shows promising results on the 3D classification and segmentation tasks.</p><p>The Point Cloud Transformer (PCT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[231]</ref> is a parallel work to <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[230]</ref> and motivated by the permutation invariance property of Transformers. However, compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[230]</ref>, it is more directly based on the conventional Transformer architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and does not involve vector attention. The key modifications include a 3D coordinate-based position encoding, an offset attention module, and a neighbor embedding that encodes local 3D structure in point-clouds. Specifically, the offset attention layer calculates the difference between the self-attended features and the input features using element-wise subtraction. The local neighbor embedding simply finds self-attention relationships among a group of points instead of individual 3D points. Explicitly incorporating local neighbourhood information makes this a more efficient architecture compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[230]</ref>. The method shows promising performance on 3D shape classification, normal estimation and segmentation tasks on ModelNet40 <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[232]</ref> and ShapeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">[233]</ref> datasets.</p><p>The Mesh Transformer (METRO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> model targets 3D human pose and mesh reconstruction from a single 2D image. A key challenge here is to faithfully learn the non-local interactions between body-joints and mesh vertices (e.g., hand and foot). The expressivity of Transformer network is used to jointly model vertex to vertex relationships in a mesh as well as the vertex to body-joint relationships. The self-attention mechanism can attend to any combination of vertices in the mesh, thereby encoding non-local relationships. The multi-layer Transformer architecture sequentially performs dimensionality reduction to map the 2D image to 3D mesh. Position encoding is performed using the 3D coordinates (x,y,z) of each vertex and each body-joint. Similar to masked language modeling in NLP, METRO uses masked vertex modeling (MVM) which randomly masks some percentage of input queries (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16</ref>). The Transformer is tasked with regressing all the joints and vertices which helps encode inter-dependencies between them. METRO obtains state-of-the-art results on human mesh reconstruction on Human3.6M <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[234]</ref> and 3DPW <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">[235]</ref> datasets. Since the approach does not depends on a parametric mesh model, it generalizes well to other reconstruction tasks such as 3D hand reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[236]</ref>. Overall, this is the first effort to employ Transformers for 3D human reconstruction tasks and leads to fairly good results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">OPEN CHALLENGES &amp; FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p>Despite excellent performance from Transformer models and their interesting salient features (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>), there exist several challenges associated with their applicability to practical settings (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>). The most important bottlenecks include requirement for large-amounts of training data and associated high computational costs. There have also been some challenges to visualize and interpret Transformer models. In this section, we provide an overview of these challenges, mention some of the recent efforts to address those limitations and highlight the open research questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">High Computational Cost</head><p>As discussed in Sec. 1, a strength of Transformer models is their flexibility to scale to high parametric complexity. While this is a remarkable property that allows training enormous sized models, this results in high training and inference cost (a detailed comparison between CNN and ViTs is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>). As an example, the BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> basic model (with 109 million parameters) took around 1.89 peta-flop days 2 for training, while the latest GPT3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> model (175 billion parameters) took around 3640 peta-flop days for training (a staggering ∼1925× increase). This comes with a huge price tag, e.g., according to one estimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[237]</ref>, GPT3 training might have cost OpenAI 4.6 million USD. Additionally, these large-scale models require aggressive compression (e.g., distillation) to make them feasible for realworld settings.</p><p>An empirical study on the scalability of Vision Transformers for number of parameters (ranging from five million to two billion), size of the training datasets (ranging from 30 million to three billion training images), and compute budget (1-10000 TPU core-days) is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">[238]</ref>. From this study, We can draw the following conclusions (a) scaling up on compute, model and size of training samples improves performance (b) only large models (with more parameters) can benefit from more training data, and the performance of smaller models platueas quickly and can not leverage from additional data. This indicates that large scale models have the capacity to further enhance their representation learning capabilities. However, with the current designs, scaling upon Transformer models is expensive and compute prohibitive, thus necessitating the need for efficient designs.</p><p>In the language domain, recent works focus on reducing the high complexity of Transformer models (basically arising from the self-attention mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> where a token's representation is updated by considering all tokens from the previous layer). For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[245]</ref> explore selective or sparse attention to previous layer tokens while updating each next layer token. Linformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> reduces complexity of standard self-attention operation from O(n 2 ) to O(n) (both in time and memory requirements). The main idea is to show that a low-rank matrix is sufficient to model the selfattention mechanism. The Reformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">[246]</ref> employed locally-sensitive hashing (LSH) to minimize the complexity of self-attention from O(n 2 ) to O(nlog(n)). In similar pursuit, the recent Lambda Networks propose to model local context as a linear function which helps reduce complexity of self-attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">[247]</ref>. These linear function lambdas are applied to the input query to model contextual relationships between pixels.</p><p>Vyas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">[248]</ref> developed an efficient cluster attention to deal with large input sequences that approximates the original self-attention. The cluster attention groups queries into clusters and then computes attention between cluster centers (instead of attention between all the queries that leads to quadratic complexity). The main idea is that the queries close in the Euclidean space should have similar attention distributions. With a fixed number of clusters, this intuition helps reduce the quadratic complexity to linear 2. A peta-flop day is a measure of computation and equals to performing 10 15 neural net operations per second for one complete day.</p></div>

We refer interested readers to a survey on efficient Transformers in NLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Similar to the NLP domain, computer vision models also suffer from the high computational cost of Transformer models. For example, image generators that are based on sequence-based Transformers (e.g., iGPT) have a high compute cost limiting their applicability to high-resolution inputs. The time and memory cost of core self-attention operation in Transformers increases quadratically with the number of patches, i.e. O(n 2 ), for n image patches (in some applications, e.g., low-level vision, n = H × W where H, W denote the height and width of the image). This is a major drawback of existing Transformers that hinders their application to most tasks involving high-resolution (HR) images, such as object detection and segmentation (in highlevel vision), and super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, etc. (in low-level vision). Numerous methods have been proposed that make special design choices to perform selfattention more 'efficiently', for instance employing pooling/downsampling in self-attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">[219]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">[249]</ref>, local window-based attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">[250]</ref>, axial-attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">[251]</ref>, low-rank projection attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[252]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[253]</ref>, ker-nelizable attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">[254]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">[255]</ref>, and similarity-clustering based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">[246]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">[256]</ref>. However, almost all of these approaches either come with a trade-off between complexity and accuracy, require special hardware specifications or are still not applicable to very large images. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop an efficient self-attention mechanism that can be applied to HR images on resourcelimited systems without compromising accuracy. It will be interesting to explore how existing models can be extended to high-dimensional cases e.g., using a multi-scale transformer design with a somewhat local context modeling. By inducing inductive biases based on our understanding of the visual learning tasks (e.g., spatial relationships in the local neighbourhood), the high computational cost can be reduced. Similarly, using sparse attention maps modeled with low-rank factorization in the matrices can also help towards reducing the computational cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[211]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Large Data Requirements</head><p>Since Transformer architectures do not inherently encode inductive biases (prior knowledge) to deal with visual data, they typically require large amount of training to figure out the underlying modality-specific rules. For example, a CNN has inbuilt translation invariance, weight sharing, and partial scale invariance due to pooling operations or multiscale processing blocks. However, a Transformer network needs to figure out these image-specific concepts on its own from the training examples. Similarly, relationships between video frames need to be discovered automatically by the self-attention mechanism by looking at a large database of video sequences. This results in longer training times, a significant increase in computational requirements, and large datasets for processing. For example, the ViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> model requires hundreds of millions of image examples to obtain reasonable performance on the ImageNet benchmark dataset. The question of learning a Transformer in a dataefficient manner is an open research problem and recent works report encouraging steps towards its resolution. For example, DeiT <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> uses a distillation approach to achieve data efficiency while T2T (Tokens-to-Token) ViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> models local structure by combining spatially close tokens together, thus leading to competitive performance when trained only on ImageNet from scratch (without pre-training). By incorporating CNNs like feature hierarchies in ViTs to effectively capture local image cues, ViTs (e.g., CCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>, NesT <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>) can be trained from scratch even on small-scale datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10). Another approach to data efficient training of ViTs is proposed in et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[257]</ref>. The authors show that by smoothing the local loss surface using sharpness-aware minimizer (SAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">[258]</ref>, ViTs can be trained with simple data augmentation scheme (random crop, and horizontal flip) <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[259]</ref>, instead of employing compute intensive strong data augmentation strategies, and can outperform their counterpart ResNet models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Vision Tailored Transformer Designs</head><p>We note that most of the existing works focused on vision tasks tend to directly apply NLP Transformer models on computer vision problems. These include architectures designed for image recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, video understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and especially multi-modal processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref>. Although the initial results from these simple applications are quite encouraging and motivate us to look further into the strengths of self-attention and self-supervised learning, current architectures may still remain better tailored for language problems (with a sequence structure) and need further intuitions to make them more efficient for visual inputs. For example, vector attention from <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> is a nice work in this direction which attempts to specifically tailor self-attention operation for visual inputs via learning channel-wise attentions. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[260]</ref> uses a Jigsaw puzzle based self-supervision loss as a parallel branch in the Transformers to improve person re-identification. A recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> rearranges the spatially close tokens to better model relationships in spatially proximal locations. Token distillation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> from pre-trained CNN models has also been used as a remedy to inject domain biases in the representations. One may argue that the architectures like Transformer models should remain generic to be directly applicable across domains, we notice that the high computational and time cost for pre-training such models demands novel design strategies to make their training more affordable on vision problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Neural Architecture Search for ViTs</head><p>While Nerual Architecuter Search (NAS) has been well explored for CNNs to find an optimized architecture, it is relatively less explored in Transformers (even for language transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b260">[261]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[262]</ref>). Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">[263]</ref> propose a one-shot NAS for vision transformers, called AutoFormer. BossNAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[264]</ref> searches for a hybrid architecture (CNN and Transformer). Another recent effort studies the tradeoff between global and local information in Transformers in the context of vision applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[265]</ref>. It will be insightful to further explore the domain-specific design choices (e.g., the contrasting requirements between language and vision domains) using NAS to design more efficient and lightweight models similar to CNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Interpretability of Transformers</head><p>Through an extensive set of carefully designed experiments, Naseer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">[266]</ref> investigate multiple intriguing properties of ViTs in terms of their generalization and robustness. They show that, compared with CNNs, ViTs demonstrate strong robustness against texture changes and severe occlusions, e.g.ViTs retain upto 60% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet once 80% of the image content is randomly occluded. Given the strong performance of Transformer architectures, it is interesting and critical to interpret their decisions, e.g., by visualizing relevant regions in an image for a given classification decision. The main challenge is that the attention originating in each layer, gets inter-mixed in the subsequent layers in a complex manner, making it difficult to visualize the relative contribution of input tokens towards final predictions. This is an open problem, however, some recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">[267]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">[269]</ref> target enhanced interpretability of Transformers and report encouraging results. Attention roll-out and attention flow methods were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">[268]</ref> to estimate the accurate attentions. However, this method functions in an ad-hoc manner and makes simplistic assumptions e.g., input tokens are linearly combined using attention weights across the layers. Chefer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">[269]</ref> note that the attention scores obtained directly via the self-attention process (encoding relationships between tokens) or reassignments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">[268]</ref> do not provide an optimal solution. As an alternative, they propose to assign and propagate relevancy scores in the Transformer network such that the sum of relevancy is constant throughout the network. Their design can handle both the positive and negative attributions experienced in the self-attention layer. The proposed framework has an added advantage of being able to provide class-specific visualizations. Despite these seminal works, visualizing and interpreting Transformers is an unsolved problem and methods are needed to obtain spatially precise activation-specific visualizations. Further progress in this direction can help in better understanding the Transformer models, diagnosing any erroneous behaviors and biases in the decision process. It can also help us design novel architectures that can help us avoid any biases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Hardware Efficient Designs</head><p>Large-scale Transformer networks can have intensive power and computation requirements, hindering their deployment on edge devices and resource-constrained environments such as internet-of-things (IoT) platforms. Some recent efforts have been reported to compress and accelerate NLP models on embedded systems such as FPGAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">[270]</ref>. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">[270]</ref> used an enhanced block-circulant matrix-based representation to compress NLP models and proposed a new Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architecture design to efficiently manage resources for high throughput and low latency. They could achieve 27x, 3x and 81x improvements in performance (throughput measured in FPS), reduced power consumption, and energy efficiency relative a CPU for RoBERTa model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Towards this goal, <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[262]</ref> proposed to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) using neural architecture search strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b270">[271]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[273]</ref>. Specifically, a SuperTransformer model is first trained for performance approximation which can estimate a model's performance without fully training it. This model comprises the largest possible model in the search space while sharing weights between common parts. Eventually, an evolutionary search is performed considering the hardware latency constraints to find a suitable SubTransformer model for a target hardware platform (e.g., IoT device, GPU, CPU). However, such hardware efficient designs are currently lacking for the vision Transformers to enable their seamless deployment in resource-constrained devices. Further, the search cost of the evolutionary algorithms remains significant with the associated impact of CO2 emissions on the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Towards Integrating All Modalities</head><p>Since Transformers provide a unified design to process different modalities, recent efforts also focus on proposing more generic general purpose reasoning systems based on Transformers. Inspired by the biological systems that can process information from a diverse range of modalities, Perceiver model <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">[274]</ref> aims to learn a unified model that can process any given input modality without making domain-specific architectural assumptions. In order to scale to high-dimensional inputs, Perceiver uses an asymmetric cross attention method to distill input information into lowdimensional latent bottleneck features. Once the features are distilled in a compact and fixed-dimensional form, regular Transformer blocks are applied in the latent space. The original Perceiver model shows performance competitive to ResNets and ViTs on image classification and can process 3D data, audio, images, video or their combinations. However, this model can only generate fixed outputs e.g., class probabilities. A recent improvement called Perceiver IO <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">[275]</ref> aims to learn models with both flexible inputs as well as arbitrary sized outputs. This allows application to problems which demand structured outputs such as natural language tasks and visual comprehension. While these models avoid modality dependent architectural choices, the learning itself still involves modality dependent choices e.g., specific augmentations or positional encodings. An interesting and open future direction is to achieve total modality-agnosticism in the learning pipeline.</p></div>

This survey reviews the self-attention approaches and specifically focuses on the Transformer and bidirectional encoding architectures that are built on the principle of self-attention. We first cover fundamental concepts pertaining to self-attention architectures and later provide an in-depth analysis of competing approaches for a broad range of computer vision applications. Specifically, we include state of the art self-attention models for image recognition, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation, video analysis and classification, visual question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, image captioning, visionlanguage navigation, clustering, few-shot learning, and 3D data analysis. We systematically highlight the key strengths and limitations of the existing methods and particularly elaborate on the important future research directions. With its specific focus on computer vision tasks, this survey provides a unique view of the recent progress in self-attention and Transformer-based methods. We hope this effort will drive further interest in the vision community to leverage the potential of Transformer models and improve on their current limitations e.g., reducing their carbon footprint.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Statistics on the number of times keywords such as BERT, Self-Attention, and Transformers appear in the titles of Peerreviewed and arXiv papers over the past few years (in Computer Vision and Machine Learning).
